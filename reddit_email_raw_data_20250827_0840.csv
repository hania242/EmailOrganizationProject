r/gmail,creating gmail for an organization without giving a phone number,"i want to create a gmail account for an organization. we just want the free version. the thing is, the heads of the organization change every year and not the same ppl will be accessing the gmail all the time. i don't want to give my phone number because then it would ask me to verify every time someone wants to login, and i will not be able to do that since i would no longer be part of the organization in the future. 

I've tried other alternatives like protonmail which doesn't ask for phone number, but it's not good enough, since we need to be able to access google drive.

r/gmail,Organizing Multiple Emails For Contacts in Gmail,"\*I mostly use Gmail on my macbook, but I do have it on my iphone as well\*

As a volunteer, I run a gmail account for a local school band. I basically get emailed by the directors that this roster of kids is going on a field trip and I need to email their parents with information. In this day and age, a lot of kids have 3+ parents attached to their file. The last volunteer organized the contacts by parent's names with a note with the kid's name. But while searching by the kid's name works in Contacts, it doesn't in Gmail, which makes sending any email long and tedious. I have to have two tabs open to search by child in Contacts, then when I find the parent(s) names, search again by parent name in Gmail.

I tried a test contact that is by the kid's name with multiple emails with a label for each parent's names, but if I search by kid's name in Gmail, all emails show up, but it will only select one at a time, I have to insert each email individually. So typing in a kid's name each time per parent. There's gotta be an easier way to do this. Plus it seems by doing it that way, I can't even search by parent name in Contacts even though I saved the email within the contact with a label. 

Does anyone have an idea to streamline this so I don't spend over an hour every time I need to send an email?",0,5,2025-07-07 17:02:09,organization,https://reddit.com/r/GMail/comments/1ltuyxr/organizing_multiple_emails_for_contacts_in_gmail/

I am on iOS.,"I‚Äôve looked and looked and looked but I can‚Äôt find a way to get messages to go straight to labels skip the Inbox

 I had a hell of a time just finding the label filtering options (if you can even call it that now) - they seem more or less hidden.  You‚Äôd think you could edit labels/folders directly from the side panel that shows all label names, but no.

There‚Äôs a ‚ÄúCustomization‚Äù area that‚Äôs hard to find (at least in the Gmail app, you have to jump through hoops) and when I went to the web browser version to see if things were more adjustable there, GMail seems completely broken and useless.  Halp.  

And as far as anything resembling filtering (and as far as I can tell, filtering is essentially gone actually) - so hard to find - you have to scroll down past your labels all the way down to click on settings, go to Inbox Customizations, click on Labels, then scroll down to the label vs there being a search function to bring you to the label you want (I have many), then click on that label.  
And careful, if your finger accidentally glances the screen, it will disappear and you have to start back again at clicking settings.

Once you‚Äôve managed to quest your way to what‚Äôs left of label options you‚Äôre given one option in terms of what used to be called filtering - an option to  ‚ÄúAutomatically Add future messages‚Äù

There is no option to bring all your old messages via this poor man‚Äôs ‚Äúfilter‚Äù into the label, and no option to ‚Äúskip inbox‚Äù either.
I checked - label added messages will still go to the inbox as well as the label.   Which makes this pretty damn pointless because if you want to clear your inbox you‚Äôve still got to individually click and move individual messages.  Good GOD.

r/gmail,Sent Box Cluttered with mail I did not send on a forwarded account.,"Does anyone else have this issue?

When you forward emails to another gmail account, the forwarded account's sent folder becomes cluttered with mail that was sent TO me not BY me. Any message with my address in the from field appears in the sent folder for my forwarded account. This is NOT an issue in the account doing the forwarding. Only the account being forwarded to.

Since ""spoofing"" from addresses is THE DEFAULT practice in bulk mailers like Mailchimp and Constant contact, very quickly the sent folder on the account I am forwarding to becomes cluttered with mail BEING SENT TO ME NOT BY ME. This makes is hard to see the messages I've actually sent and is a deal breaker for forwarding.

You can reproduce this by forwarding in gmail, then sending test mails in mail chimp (or your own mail server):An example from address (of the mail sent to me) looks like this:

My Name &lt;MY\_EMAIL\_HERE&gt; Using Mailchimp Mailer - \*\*CID5ce50a813f=5F=5Ftest=5Femail=5F=5F\*\*

There are some headers you could read to fix this like:

X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-To, Delivered-To

These make it clear I did not SEND these messages.

I need a clear response if this is intended or a BUG, I noticed it around a year ago?

I pay for workspaces &amp; support was useless and tricky to get on the phone. Is there a way I can get better support? 

The forum said you need to login when I'm already logged in on one account and past post limit on another. I will either elevate this until it is fixed or drop workspaces and run my own mail servers. IT IS CAUSING ME STRESS @ WORK, and the only resolution I have now is NOT USING FORWARDING.

Details:

I'm using workspaces with my domains but I suspect this issue is in gmail as well. I've tried setting up the forwarding in 4 different ways, it does not matter the bug is how gmail determines what is sent mail.

Ways to forward (this is a mess, because of multiple ways I had to try them all):

1. Create a ""faux"" account with multiple members using a group inAdmin Console -&gt; Home -&gt; Groups
2. Forward with Gear -&gt; All Settings -&gt; Forwarding
3. Forward with Gear -&gt; All Settings -&gt; Create a filter (so you can forward to more then 1 address)
4. In account being forwarded to -&gt; Gear -&gt; All Settings -&gt; Accouts -&gt; Check mail from other accounts(to get #4 to work you have to allow 2factor in workspace admin account, then turn on 2fa for the account you are forwarding from, then create an app password and use pop.gmail.com port 995/SSL, then put up with a minor delay when checking email)

r/gmail,Why am I getting continual junk mail from an obvious spammer domain + other details,"First off, I want to apologize if this has been a topic raised before. This is my first post on this reddit, but I'm very frustrated on how gmail - maybe I should say \*GOOGLE\* - is handling this because none of this stuff should even be delivered to users at all ... anywhere.

Here are some things I want to say what is going on. Somehow, I am getting junk mail from a \*.us account. In these emails, there are links. There is stuff clicking to things to the storage googleapis address with various other things after that link. There are also some telling points - when you show the original message, it says this DKIM: FAIL + DMARC + FAIL. They all clutter up going into my spam folder ...

That's nice to know the spam folder WORKS, but this can all be a lot better. Since these emails continually show DKIM: FAIL + DMARC + FAIL, the links in those emails always go to some suspicious googleapis address (which we all know Google can screen first), and the domain is always ends in .US why can't gmail - GOOGLE - finally kick back these emails and never deliver them to users - even in the spam folder? The only true workaround I found to get rid of seeing them at all is put all .us emails to the trash automatically ... but that means things like other legit .us stuff (such as adidas emails) go there too.

r/gmail,Disgusting Google Extortion Tactics,"So Google doesn't really tell you that you get 15GB across all its services. Well they do but it's purposely not that clear until you realize you can't send or receive Emails, I didn't know that applied wholly even to Emails. I fell into their disgusting tactic where I had paid to backup my Pictures &amp; Videos to Google Photos on the main email that I use. I filled up about 50GB of storage that I had purchased, once I stopped paying, I had stopped receiving Emails. For months now I had my Email linked to Apple mail, and I had never gotten an email in months, Apple mail is bad enough already as it doesn't even tell you your storage is full which adds much to the burn. So I checked my Gmail today and lo and behold I see that I can no longer send or receive Emails. Because Google tricked me into paying for storage, that they so conveniently share over every other service. So if you ever pay for storage, and you ever wanna send and receive Emails again, you better stay in that subscription for your whole life, otherwise bye bye Emails.

 It is so infuriatingly scummy and greedy that they do it this way, to force your hand to buy storage for Emails. Emails are a necessity, they don't even try to look fair by giving at least a 1GB storage allocated for Email regardless of storage. I wouldn't even have been mad if for example you had to pay to be able to download the backup onto your phone again, that makes more sense than simply cluttering the Email and having that thing above it with a red box saying you need to upgrade or cleanup storage. Well I guess this is what you get from google monopoly. If I had known I would've never backed up my photos on this email. So word to the wise, if you ever want to use google services, have an account allocated for each different service, especially for phone backup, use only one account just to use google photos backup. Make sure you never use other services that take storage on the same account you use your Email, because that 15GB is gone. 

And then they laugh at you with the option of either ""Upgrading"" or Cleaning up space. So I have to delete my whole backup now to use my email again. And if you had paid for the 1TB and didn't realize your email was gonna be f\*\*\*ed, then you better keep paying or move your backup to another account. What's even funnier also is that I tried to pay with paypal, and it didn't work, they send me the confirmation code and everything but paypal does not work on Google One, it says ""unavailable"" after confirming and everything. I saw some post saying they had issue with paypal on google play, I don't know if that's also by design or not.

r/gmail,I‚Äôve made a mess,"So a couple years ago I decided to turn on some option for automatically creating contacts in gmail for every incoming email that I get, but now I‚Äôm at a point where they‚Äôre a complete mess of thousands of irrelevant contacts that are just clogging up my contact list.

I thought this is what I wanted but I‚Äôve come to realize it was really only the senders that I actually respond to that are necessary for me to have added to my contacts list. But now I can‚Äôt figure out how to mass delete all the senders I never responded to that somehow still ended up there. 

I tried googling around but the generic AI answer I get is ‚Äúit's likely because you have the ""Create contacts for auto-complete"" setting enabled in your Gmail settings, which means Gmail will automatically add new email addresses you interact with to your contacts list‚Äù ‚Äî but even senders I never interact with get added to my contacts list??

From what I can tell this is pretty clearly what the setting in gmail even says itself:‚ÄúWhen I send a message to a new person, add them to Other Contacts so that I can auto-complete to them next time‚Äù -- but that obviously means I have to *actually* respond and/or interact with them first *before* they get added to my contacts right? So I honestly dont understand what setting I turned on to have every single incoming email get added to my contacts.

r/gmail,"Gmail/Google Account Recovery Success Story &amp; Guide - I tried everything, here is what I learned:","Hey everyone, I wanted to share my experience recovering my Google account after losing access. I know firsthand how frustrating and stressful it can be, especially since Google doesn‚Äôt offer direct support for this. And most people who post here don't give updates on their situation. I've read countless posts on here and other places and I have tried everything. Here's what worked, what didn‚Äôt, and what I learned. Hopefully, this helps someone in the same situation.


What Happened:
My trusted devices were stolen. I didn't know my password and I had 2FA enabled with an authenticator app (I don't have access to) and a recovery phone number (I have access to), but no recovery email. I quickly realized that without access to at least one recovery method, getting back in is extremely difficult.

If you‚Äôve lost your recovery phone number, here are some ideas how to recover it:
- Try calling the new owner of the number and see if they‚Äôll help.
- If the number is inactive, visit your provider‚Äôs store and politely ask if they can reactivate it. They may refuse, but if you offer to sign up for a contract, they may be more willing to help as they get commission. (This worked for me for my pay as you go SIM that was stolen with my phone)


What I Tried (What DIDN‚ÄôT Work)
- I subscribed to Google One, hoping to get premium customer support. After multiple chats, I found out Google One support doesn‚Äôt handle account recovery. They only provide generic advice (which you can already find online).
- I created a Google Workspace account and even bought a domain just to see if they offered better support. The support team was more responsive, they requested a call back from the YouTube support team in California. I spoke with them a few times but it became clear that they can not help with account recovery.
- Contacting @madebygoogle &amp; @askworkplace on X (Twitter): No useful response.
- Posting on Google Account Help Forum: No replies or assistance.


What COULD Work for You
Contacting @TeamYouTube on X (Twitter): If your Google account is tied to a YouTube channel and it was hacked, they might help.
My mistake was sounding too desperate in my first tweet, so they ignored me. I changed my approach to something more casual, like: ""Hey @TeamYouTube, my channel got hacked, can you help me get it back? ü§û""
They DM‚Äôd me asking for a active Gmail account so they can grant it access to the account recovery form which also puts me in contact with the specialist team. They provided me with the link to the form that asked different questions: channel URL, devices info, IP, when I last used the account, etc. 
I was optimistic about recovering my account after completing the form. However, minutes later, I received an automated email stating, ""Based on the info you gave us, our specialists couldn‚Äôt find evidence that your Google Account was compromised.""
I responded, explaining that my account wouldn‚Äôt show typical signs of hijacking since my trusted devices were stolen and therefore any access would look legitimate. To prove ownership, I created a detailed document with screenshots of my video editing files, a photo of myself, and even my ID. They said that they will review my case again but got back to me with the same decision. Despite multiple follow-ups providing more evidence, they continued to deny my request. Ultimately, it became clear that if your account wasn‚Äôt hacked but simply lost or locked out, YouTube support won‚Äôt assist with recovery even if you have YouTube channel featuring your face .
If your account was actually hijacked and you have YouTube channel associated to it, this method could work for you.


What FINALLY Worked for Me

1. Understanding Google‚Äôs Recovery Loops
For the first 2 weeks, I was stuck in the recovery loop where every attempt led to:
""Try another way.""
""Sorry, you didn‚Äôt provide enough information.""
I learned that if you attempt recovery 6+ times using the same method (for me that was phone number), it locks that option for a period of time, you'll see a message saying: ""Unavailable because of too many failed attemp, try again in a few hours"". It turned out that a few hours is actually a week so I left my account for a week without trying anything.

2. Waiting for a Week to Reset Recovery Attempts
After waiting 7 days, and multiple tries to recover my account, I got locked out from using my phone as a recovery option again . Exactly at that time a new option appeared that I haven't seen before:
‚ÄúChoose how you want to sign in:‚Äù
My phone was listening as the only way to sign in.
But because my phone number was locked due to too many attemps I could not click on that option. Again I had to wait a week, so frustrating.
3. Finally success 
After a week I tried to log back in and guess what after 4 attempts I did not get that option. I was back to the recovery loop.
I started thinking about how to improve my chances to get back the option to sing in with my number. 
One of the tips is to use a familiar IP address. However, I found out that home internet providers including mine have dynamic IPs that change regularly. That's probably the reason why I was not presented with the option. But I also found that Businesses often use static IPs, and decided to try logging in from my workplace using incognito mode on Chrome browser, and success! On the first try after veryfing my phone the option was back! After verifying my phone number I saw this: 
""Get a link to recover your account.

You'll need to wait 48 hours for an email to help you sign in. Google needs time to make sure this

I provided my new email and verified it with a code.
After anxiously waiting 49 hours, I got an email with a one-time sign-in link.
This link allowed me to reset my password and regain access to my account. Oooo sweet success! After a total of 1 month and 3 days being locked out of my account I was finally back in.


Recovery Tips
- Try logging in from places you frequently visit and use WiFi (work, favorite caf√©, etc.).
- Don‚Äôt lock yourself out by attempting too many recoveries in a row using the same recovery in method. 
- If you do get locked out wait at least 7 days between attempts .
- Try different browsers, devices, and locations each time.
- If you lost access (but weren‚Äôt hacked), don‚Äôt waste time with Google/YouTube support‚Äîthey won‚Äôt help.
- Google monitors inactivity and may remove 2FA barriers over time.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you‚Äôve had a similar experience. Stay patient, and don‚Äôt give up!",69,128,2025-04-06 20:31:42,too many emails,https://reddit.com/r/GMail/comments/1jszjg9/gmailgoogle_account_recovery_success_story_guide/

r/gmail,Google called me and told me phone number change was in process,"**\*THIS IS A SCAM - DO NOT FALL FOR IT - GOOGLE WILL NEVER CALL YOU ABOUT SUSPECTED FRAUD - THEY NEVER NEED 2FA FOR BACKEND ACCESS\***

So middle of the day today I got a call from google fraud department via 650-203-0000 informing me that there was a phone number change was in process for my main gmail account. It was an American agent, highly professional speaking, and he verified my existing number and informed me of the number that it was attempting to be changed to, the location that this was initiated from (Toronto, Canada), and that there was also an attempt made to change my recovery email.

They provided me the new recovery that email was being attempted, and he asked me to verify whether I was aware of that email address or phone number or if I had visited Toronto or had any family in the area. When I told him no he proceeded to verify my current location and whether this was correct and I told him yes.

Next, he said he was going to move forward with locking down my account by changing my password and logging out all sessions except for the sessions in the location that I currently reside.¬†**To finalize the process he wanted to get a 2FA from me**¬†and guided me through the process of using google authenticator, and then he wanted me to accept the push notification and when I told him I had pushes didn't work on my phone reliabily he said no problem and asked me to provide him my rotating 2FA.

This is where I got really hesitant. I tried to confirm that he really was from google, and he told me that this was their official number. Sure enough,¬†[this guide](https://www.analyticsthatprofit.com/blog/what-to-do-when-you-get-a-phone-call-from-google)¬†seems to mention that calls from¬†**650-203-0000**¬†are legitimate. But then I told him that I was aware that phone numbers could be spoofed and that I was still hesitant to proceed with giving him my 2FA, which he said he understood. I asked him if there could be a way instead where I call inbound and get connected with an agent that could help me proceed and he said that there was not and Google does not accept inbound security concerns like that and you must file a case and they will reach out to you instead. This checked out in my head because I had a coworker that went through an account recovery process and it was very arduous and took over a month and I remember him also mentioning that there was really no way to escalate to get to a knowledgable agent. This was the way to initiate the security lockdown.

So then with him on the phone I checked my Google security account activity page and I¬†**did not see any unrecognized sessions**. This really got me concerned and I asked him about this and he informed me that this was the result of some security exploit that seems to involve browser cache and so no new sessions would appear, and Google's team was actively working on patching this issue. So, like some 0day exploit.

I asked him when this was initiated and he said roughly 12 hours ago, which I found it a little odd that they were just finally getting around to calling me. Still hesitant, I told him that I didn't want to give him my 2FA but he insisted, telling me that the phone number change was in process and he needed this final approval in order to complete the security process to stop the inflight change. It almost seemed as if Google messed up and recently identified this ""cache"" exploit and were reaching out to different people about this and he sounded pretty legitimate. He said after giving him my 2FA code I'd receive a text with my new password.

**Eager not to let a potential hack go any further I caved in and gave it to him,**¬†and then he informed me that he had successfully locked down my account to only my active sessions and I promptly received a text message with a randomly generated password, as promised. He told me to use this password and he recommended to not update it again for 24 hours because it could lock out my account due to too many account changes. He then informed me that in 48 hours I would receive a follow-up call from a manager about this case and he asked me if I had any more questions. I asked him how this could have happened and if any of my other gmail accounts could have been affected, but he said no other accounts related to my number showed any suspicious activity and it could have been a browser add-on or a website I was using and that they were patching the issue and politely asked me if I had any other questions and we ended the call.

Still worried, I quickly accessed my account which was already in a cached session and my fingerprint passkey 2FA still worked to let me into my security settings and I promptly changed my password again. I figure it'd be better to be locked out vs completely screwed in case that was a fake agent! And when I checked my Gmail activity this time I actually found¬†**a ""Asus ROG Phone 5"" device that I did not recognize under my Gmail and my Drive activity around the time of the phone call, but before the time that I had provided him my 2FA**¬†(which I changed during the call and its timestamp was a few minutes later)**, but showing a ""Signed out"" state.**¬†Interestingly, this device did not show up under My Devices, only under the activity for these specific apps.

**Since the call I have changed my password, changed my 2FA app/code, disabled ""Skip password when possible"", removed all ""Google prompt"" access, updated my recovery email, and reviewed my passkeys email and phone number and all of my account activity.**

What do you guys think? Was this a legitimate Google employee or a scammer with a clever backstory? If legitimate..how did this happen? I never got a random 2FA prompt or anything with the initial attack, and I thought 2FA would prevent being able to access my gmail or allow a phone number change or anything major....was I the victim of a 0-day 2FA bypass attack of some sort? And is there anything else I should be checking? Thanks for listening!!

UPDATE 1- The ""manager"" never called me back...obviously. Complete scam.  
UPDATE 2- A few weeks later another caller attempted this same exact scam on me..but what the agent had to say next was..unexpected.

r/gmail,Is gmail safe to use any more?,"To explain in few words.. I started a company and created a gmail account to have an email address. In the following week I created all my accounts for paid online services (DigitalOcean, Namecheap, Stripe, Mailgun and many more). I applied for these paid services, added my debit card to be chrged.  
Naively, I used my new gmail account (which is by the way verified with my personal gmail account) to create accounts and log into all of these services.  
And today, Google finally decided that my account is suspicious and I got a ""Verify it‚Äôs you"" screen with a message ""To help keep your account secure, Google needs to verify it‚Äôs you. Please sign in again to continue.""  
Who are they trying to keep the account safe from? ME?!  
I used a physical key and my personal gmail account to secure this new one, and suddenly I cannot access it.  
Honestly I whish someone had hacked into my account rather than this happening. Why? Because when I try to verify this stupid account now, google says both of my phone numbers had been used too many times. That was hilarious! I literally used one phone to get the code which never arrived, an then tried another one which I couldn't even use.  
What is even more hilarious is the statement in the ""help"" document which says that if you used your phone too many times (according to their stupid algorithm) you should try ""someone else's phone"" XD  
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!  
So if someone were to steal my account they would be able to verify it with someone else's phone?! Buy a burner and get yourself a free gmail account :D So instead of using a perfectly safe method, like for example my recovery email address, no, use someone else's phone..

My question to google here is: how safe is it to use your accounts any more. I use gmail accounts for login to many services. How do I feel safe any more without worrying that you may lock my email for such a stupid unprovoked reason, offer literally no support, and state that if I don't verify my account it may be deleted?!  
This is literally the stupidest policy I have seen so far.. And I never expected Google to go this way against their users.

Little update:  
I thought I would update the topic. I created a Proton email account for my business and moved everything there. However, I went back to that wretched gmail account to close it, it got locked up again XD  
Same thing with verification etc.. Really Google, you have convinced me to redirect my trust completely away from you.",23,50,2024-10-29 23:21:48,too many emails,https://reddit.com/r/GMail/comments/1gf5w17/is_gmail_safe_to_use_any_more/
r/gmail,Gmail keeps wanting to send recovery verification code to phone instead of email,"When I tried to sign into my gmail account yesterday, I was told there was something suspicious about my activity. So I followed the process they presented me with. At the end, they asked me to enter a phone number where they could send the verification code. When I entered my number, they said the phone had been used too many times - I have different gmail accounts for personal emails, for my freelancing gig, for applying to jobs, for social media  profiles, and for signing up to news websites and different types of newsletters. So that checks out.

The thing that is confusing me is that I set up one of my other gmails as a recovery for the one I cannot access. So I don't understand why they are not sending the code to the recovery email? Things I have tried include the email recovery workflow, make sure I am signing in from the device I always use, and on the exact same Wifi network.

Does anyone have any other suggestions? Also, does anyone know if having four to five gmail accounts on the same device and network is somehow raising a red flag with Google?",0,8,2025-08-17 08:01:29,too many emails,https://reddit.com/r/GMail/comments/1msi1ma/gmail_keeps_wanting_to_send_recovery_verification/
r/gmail,My gmail account is running incredibly slow.  Emails take hours sometimes days to show up in my Inbox.  Google support tells me there is nothing they can do.,"I have been having a problem for awhile, but recently it has gotten quite bad.

I have been using gmail since the beginning, so like 20 years now, never once have I had a problem with it.

But lately emails have taken longer than normal to reach my inbox, sometimes when I go to send an email, it says message sent, only for it to go to my drafts folder and become unsent.

I have had my wife email me from her gmail account, in the same house, on the same network.  And it can take 6/7 hours to reach my inbox, it took 2 days last time.

I can email her, and once it goes through, she gets it immediately.  I have had colleagues and friends send me emails with different services, all of them take an exceptionally long time to show up in my inbox.  Some emails still have not shown up days later.

I have some email accounts that I check using the ""Check mail from other accounts"" feature, which is essentially just using POP3.  Some of those work and work more reliable than my gmail account, however usually 1/2 of them will say checking mail for hours, as if they are frozen.

I pay for additional storage through Google One.  However neither their support or gmail support has gotten back to me with a fix, or at least not to my knowledge since I don't get emails half the time.

I am fairly knowledgeable when it comes to IT, I manage a few small home network servers as well as an email server on AWS.  So I understand how things work to a degree, it honestly feels like a server that my gmail account is using needs to be rebooted, or has too many accounts on it, or something like that.  I am sure they use some kind of load manager, but clearly it is not working.

Is there anything I can do to fix this, I am pretty much ready to leave gmail and find an alternative.

To conform with the rules, I have tried MacOS on my 2019 Mac Pro, My M2 MacBook Pro, My Windows 11 PC, my Windows 11 Laptop, my Apple iPhone.  I have tried both laptops and my phone connected to my network, and to other networks, including my phone over cellular.

Several days ago, when I checked my current login Gmail, one of my Gmail ""**sessions expired**"", even though I just used it to check mail and drive. Then the google account said ""There is something unusual about your activity. For your security, Google wants to make sure that it‚Äôs really you.""  
  
Then I followed the steps to ""Verify it's you"" by typing the email and then the password. But no matter what kind of login method‚Äîpassword, code sent through SMS or passkey, or Google authen code‚Äîit will always reach ""Enter a phone number to get a text message with a verification code.""  
I typed my phone number in with my region is Vietnam. It always appears the red line **""We don't support delivering messages to your provider at this time. Try a number from a different provider.""**  
  
Then **""This phone number can't be used for verification, or there were too many unsuccessful attempts. Use another phone number or try again later.""**   
  
If I choose Try another way, it will say **""Google couldn't verify that this account belongs to you. Try again later or use Account Recovery for help.""**  
  
Even though that was the same phone number, Google just sent the SMS code to log in for this email. How do I have another way to recover this email with this phone number issue?   
  
Then I tried another way and picked the method that uses the recovery mail, it asked me it will check the request for 48 hours. After 2 days, I received an email in my recovery mail that said ""Good news! Because you're having trouble with 2-step verification, we'll remove it from your account. To sign in now, just click below."" When I click on sign in, the familiar need phone number appears again. I typed my phone number, and the red line **We don't support delivering messages to your provider at this time. Try a number from a different provider""** again. I tried another way and **Google couldn't verify that this account belongs to you** again.

I like to integrate 2-3 outside email accounts into my Gmail. For better overview I like to seperate their inboxes and if possible also the sent box. On the computer I can setup multiple inboxes - I created them with ""to:mail1@address.com"". I can now fold and expand the inboxes for the different mail adresses - but only on my pc. I want to have this view on my gmail android app as well - but the menu says ""you can only setup multiple inboxes on your computer"". 
Any tipps how to manage them with the app?",1,2,2024-04-28 13:31:21,inbox management,https://reddit.com/r/GMail/comments/1cf3bl5/managing_multiple_inboxes_in_gmail_app/

r/gmail,"Turning off spam filters, forwarding all emails, then managing a master / central inbox. Whats the best approach?","# Background

The TLDR is the thread title.

I know some options for doing this, but I want to get it right the first time.

As the elements are intertwined here I've refrained from posting different question threads. Much like the outcome I'm after this thread is ""all in one"".

If you're not in the mood for a long thread duck out now haha. On the plus side, I've put some structure to it.

**Headline details**

* I've more than 5 accounts (so POP3 is likely out).
* Right now everything is in Gmail (custom domain/ Workspace inboxes). Though, I'm likely to have a Microsoft 365 inbox in the mix soon on the central / master inbox side.

# ***

# Requirements

**Spam handling**

For the individual inboxes, I don't want to use Gmails spam filters at all. I want to send all emails to their respective inboxes. I'm fine with these inboxes being ""messy"". I don't plan to be looking at them.

For the master inbox, I'm undecided on whether I will leave it to Gmail to handle spam or not. . . *more on that in a moment as I have some questions.*

If you're wondering why on earth I wanna do this, I explain in the end notes.

**Reading and replying from**

Once set up, I won't be logging in to the individual accounts---unless I unavoidably have to change settings.

I need to be able to read and reply to all the emails in the individual accounts from the master inbox. Everything from these accounts need to flow to the master inbox, ""spam"" and all.

Replies also need to be sent as coming from the original inbox. So the master inbox email address would never be present in the ""from"" field on the recipients end. And the email they see would never show as a ""sent on behalf of"".

*I'm not sure what triggers the latter happening, but have seen some people talking about it as a problem.*

# Options / Possible Approach

**Turning off spam:** One option I was exploring was to set a filter. Using ""Doesn't have the words"" and then some random made up word along with ""never send to spam"" ticked.

That would reliably push everything to the inbox, right!

*Sure, it's a hacky way of doing it but what is the alternative? . . . I don't see an outright turn off spam filters option.*

Ive seen some people use the is: spam label, and then 'never send to spam' but I gather it's not reliable. Gmail also warns you if you try to use the ""is:"" parameter.

Any more ideas here?

**Reading all emails:** I was simply going to set the forwarding in the settings. Set as follows:

1. ""Forward a copy of incoming email to \[Master Inbox Address\] (in use)"" and
2. ""Mark \[Individual Accounts\] Mail's copy as read""

Possibly a snag here though . . . coming from my proposed approach to spam handling.

[This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMail/comments/15z8kv7/gmail_forwarding_issue/) suggests my 'never send to spam' filter would kick in after the forwarding trigger.

From the thread, I'm reading it that forwarding will only happen in the same moment as a message arrives. So, if an email doesn't hit the inbox right away, and instead hits spam and is then filtered to the inbox, then it's NOT gonna be forwarded.

If true, it's a bit of a ""gotcha"" for my use case. I can't have that. I can't have emails being missed.

How can I handle this?

**Replying:** In the Accounts section of the Master Inbox's settings, I'd add the inboxes to ""Send mail as"". And leave the ""Treat as an alias"" option as unticked. And the ""When replying to a message: Reply from the same address the message was sent to"" option selected.

I know this reading and replying approach works, but what are the general gotchas of doing it this way?

Not forgetting, what do I do about the spam snag?

\*\*\*

# Alternative approaches to forwarding

**Option** **A:** **POP3**

I read a few other threads here before posting this. I'm loosely aware that **POP3** could be used instead of forwarding. However. . .

* likely a non-runner as it's limited to 5 accounts\*
* plus it seems to have a longer delay factor (up to 1 hour).

*\*I found a* [*workaround*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39667907/gmails-pop3-account-import-limit-is-5-any-way-to-pull-more-than-5#:~:text=Now%20in%20GMail%2C%20although%20you,under%20Settings%20%3E%3E%20Account%20Import.) *(the""I know this is a little old, but this is what I do"" one). It seems like a lot of work. I don't mind the work, but I cant see the upside of the POP3 way.*

I've seen a few posts /comments suggesting POP3 over auto-forwarding. Still, I'm not really getting why auto-forwarding is an issue.

In what way is it less reliable than POP3?

I understand it messes with the headers. But from my testing it only does so on my end.

Best covered by an example.

*I sent an email from a personal email account to one of the individual workspace inboxes. The forwarding to my master inbox worked as expected, minimal delay (less than 1 min). And then the reply I sent from the master inbox appeared in my personal inbox. It looked as if it were sent directly from the individual workspace inbox. All as I expected.*

*I then inspected the headers of the reply message in my personal inbox via the ""show original"" option. I was expecting the headers to have some markings of the master inbox's involvement, but it didn't.*

*On the other hand, the forwarded message in my master inbox did have ""markings"". And so yes the header were ""messed up"" but why would that be a concern?*

For the folks who use POP3 over auto-forwarding, why does preserving the headers matter?

And is there anything else I'm missing here?

Before running an example, I fully expected the issue was messing up the headers when sending replies. I thought that might have some impact on the email reputation or some such. But from my small test it's seems limited to messing up headers in my master inbox. External stuff ""looks"" the same.

**Option B: Bypass the master inbox, use a third party app instead.**

Yes, I could sidestep the master inbox idea entirely. And simply hook the individual email accounts up to a third party app.

Effectively via IMAP I think.

That would let me manage the inboxes ""all in one place"" and so forth.

But the one tool I like charges per inbox, so the master inbox makes more sense.

If I want I can connect that inbox to the third party app (for different functionally reasons). I only pay for a single inbox that way.

The key is I've already validated that it can support replying from the same address the message was sent to. I just need set the ""send as"" feature properly on the Gmail side. And then list the aliases in the third party apps settings for the master inbox connected to it. Confusingly aliases has different meaning in Gmail, but in short I know this works if I want to use it.

\*\*\*\*

# End Notes (expect some repetition)

**On the Spam handling use case.**

Why do I want to put spam back in my inbox? These are business inboxes.

The bottom line I cant spend time going through each accounts spam folder. Quite a bit of spam is in fact replies / enquiries from people I want to hear from. Examples:

1. I've never emailed them. They're emailing me and my inbox hasn't seen them before.
2. I've emailed them, but they're replying to me from a different email address ; or
3. They were forwarded an email from me, but have decided to start a new thread, rather than replying on the old one.

As far as Gmail is concerned, in each case they are random never seen before external people. As a proportion of all emails, it's not gonna be a big number, but they can be substantial value.

Adding these senders to contacts in advance isn't an option.

*As to why these people are landing in spam. I don't know why. Maybe their workplace domain / private inbox hasn't built it's reputation yet or has a poor one. Or they used phrases the spam filters didn't like etc. . For the ones I've missed, often, I don't want them or others like them in my spam. So I'd rather see the spam all in one place. That's my master inbox's spam folder as filtered by Gmail. That's assuming it re-filters forwards and includes non-forward spam. Or I get everything in the master account's inbox and I set my own rules for spam.*

Let's assume I effectively turn off Gmail spam filters for the individual accounts. And I let Gmail handle spam in the master account.

What happens here?

Does all the forwarded stuff pass through the master accounts spam filters? Or is it only looking at other emails addressed to that account directly? If the latter then it's almost certainly true spam. This master accounts email address is not meant to have anything coming to it direct. It's a sorting centre.

Either way, I could probably deal with checking the master account's spam folder now and again.

But I'm half thinking of turning off Gmail's spam filters for the master too. Then dealing with it using my own filters.

If it becomes too much, I might let Gmail handle it. 

In reality I suspect most of the ""spam"" volume is gonna to originate from the individual accounts. So wondering if those forwarded emails will be re-filtered?",1,1,2023-11-14 02:18:17,inbox management,https://reddit.com/r/GMail/comments/17upc7z/turning_off_spam_filters_forwarding_all_emails/

r/gmail,Is it possible to delete emails in gmail?,"I have been ""Deleting"" emails, and ""emptying out the bin"" for the last 5 years, and, yet my storage usage keeps going up. I have spent hours going through the mailbox deleting large emails with attachments, and it's useless. Recently, I spent a good 5 hours deleting 2GB of emails, and I saw the usage decline by almost that amount. Then, a few days later, my storage usage was back to where it was as though I did not delete anything. I searched for those emails, and could not find them. I could not find any of the emails that I had deleted.

So, then, I downloaded an email client and added gmail with IMAP to it, and, all my emails were there being downloaded. - am - confused. What is going on!!! So, I spent another day deleting emails  from the client thats connected via IMAP. (nothing changed on storage usage online for gmail). Then, I deleted the email client, and a waited for a week. Loaded a new client &amp; added gmail again using IMAP. And again all the emails that I had thought were deleted - showed up.

  
What is going on here!!! I'm clueless. Deleting emails does not delete them. They're not visible in Archive or Inbox, or anywhere, but show-up when I load a client &amp; connect via IMAP.

I do not want to purchase storage space from them, and I do not want to hold onto those emails that I keep deleting. I'm pretty much close to deleting the entire gmail account as I'm fed-up. But, also, a part of me doubts that gmail will delete my account.

r/gmail,Advanced Protection Program: Finding the Security-Recovery Sweet Spot,"I‚Äôm enrolled in Google‚Äôs Advanced Protection Program and have registered more than 2 passkeys and security keys, but I deliberately left out any recovery phone number or email. My goal was to shrink my attack surface: if I did set up recovery options **but then missed Google‚Äôs alerts during the recovery delay**, an attacker could use or brute-force those channels (e.g. SIM swapping). Whereas by not having them at all, I eliminate that entire risk..

However, I‚Äôve been rethinking this after considering the following scenario: what if an attacker hijacks my session cookie? With a valid session token, they could access my inbox and download sensitive files, but could they even change my security settings? If they removed or disabled all my passkeys and security keys, I‚Äôd be completely locked out because I never set up recovery options. In that case, I‚Äôd have zero fallback.

Now, contrast that with having a recovery phone number (or email) on file. If an attacker wiped out my passkeys, there would be a recovery window (typically 1 week) during which I could receive a code to my old number or recovery email (assuming the attacker changed them immediately). That gives me a chance to spot the breach and reclaim my account before it‚Äôs permanently gone. Of course, this feature is only helpful if I notice my account being compromised before the recovery window ends and *after* the recovery delay. In fact, a recovery option only helps if the attacker‚Äôs delay for accessing my account is shorter than the time I have to recover my account using the old phone number or email. Because I‚Äôm assuming here that I haven‚Äôt noticed the alerts of the account recovery process before it‚Äôs successful, otherwise I‚Äôd have stopped it. My understanding is that it is in fact shorter. (2 days? vs 7 days)

All of this assumes that session hijacking alone is enough to change security settings in an account protected by APP. I know Google often prompts me to re-authenticate when I change these settings, but is there any way an attacker could sneak in a change without my credentials, triggering the nightmare scenario above?

Is it worth adding a recovery phone or email as a safety net, given the slight increase in attack surface? What‚Äôs the ‚Äúsafest‚Äù recommended setup for a Google account under APP: one that guards against permanent account loss if someone hijacks my session?

EDIT: If instead of compromising the account through session hijacking, they managed to use one of my recovery options, would there still be a 1-week recovery window with the old phone number/email? Or does this 1-week window only happen when you change the recovery phone number/email **without being able to verify ownership of the recovery phone number/email**?",1,6,2025-05-28 03:52:19,inbox management,https://reddit.com/r/GMail/comments/1kx3xkb/advanced_protection_program_finding_the/

\- sending to my persona account -- emails never arrive and i get the same error

\- Checking google postmaster -- my reputation is fine

\- Checking deliverability with mxtoolbox -- everything looks fine. 

  
I'm a bit lost. Seems the error is related to Mimecast somehow but debugging/solving the issue isn't obvious. 

My theory: going through the email account itself rather than through the beehiiv platform doesn't work the same way. I think the email account itself wasn't really warm and sending emails to my subscribers was considered spam and my account got blocked somehow.

r/gmail,Yahoo email management inside Gmail: Do I risk a double import of email?,"Hi,  
I recently used the 'Import mail and contacts' option in Gmail to import a ton of old emails, contacts, folders from a Yahoo email account. I now want to make it so that I can 'Reply from the same address the message was sent to' so I'll obviously use the 'Check mail from other accounts' option in Gmail and then make sure 'Reply from the same address the message was sent to' is selected.

My question is: When I do the above am I going to end up with duplicate emails, etc.? In other words will the above import old emails again? 

Also, I assume before I do the above, that I should unlink the yahoo email from the 'Import mail and contacts:' section in Gmail because it will continue to import new mails for the next month?

Any guidance would be appreciated otherwise I will just have to trial and probably error this in order to figure this out.

Hi there, folks. I am new to gmail, but not to emails or tech in general. I am trying to set up a system that has served me well in other fields for many years. Here is what I am trying to accomplish:

- Everything that comes into my inbox gets run through my filters, and plopped in folder somewhere. The dozen meeting invites I get per day go into ""Meetings"". The hundred or so JIRA ticket notifications go into ""JIRA"". You get the idea. After a few months with a company I might have 20 or so of these folders.

My ""Inbox"" only shows me whatever doesn't end up pre-filtered. That means it's usually a fifth of my normal daily email content, much easier to follow, and usually actually important information.

From what I gather in Gmail, I have labels, not folders. I was even able to create a ""has:nouserlabels"" filter, and I assume if I put that at the bottom of my list everything not caught in a filter ends up there.

r/gmail,Spam bombs - what you need to know,"Hey everyone!

I‚Äôve seen a lot of people here going through a spam attack (spam bomb) - I know how scary and overwhelming it can be.

So I wrote an article about this where I share everything you need to know about spam bombs, and what steps you can take to reduce the risk of going through one.

Spam bombs, also known as spam attacks, are cyberattacks where a scammer sends you 100s or 1000s of emails in a matter of seconds or minutes, in an attempt to flood your inbox.

How do they work?
Scammers will either gather your personal information from publicly available sources, or will simply buy this information from hackers.
They will gather information like your full name, email address, phone number, physical address and bank details.
Besides all this, they will also collect information about your PayPal account, Amazon, eBay or any other e-commerce account they can get their hands on.

What happens next?
Once they have all your info available, the next step is simple and obvious - they will go on a shopping spree with your money.
This really depends on what info they found, so let‚Äôs take them one by one.

In case they got access to your PayPal account, they will use it at the checkout on whatever retail website they want.

If they got into your Amazon, eBay or other shopping account, it‚Äôs most likely you have your payment info saved there, so this will make it even easier for them to shop.

What are the signs of a spam bomb?
These scammers are pretty smart. They know that you will get an email confirmation after every purchase, so the next step is to flood your inbox with junk.
Like I said, they have automations in place that enables them to send you 1000s of emails in just a few minutes.
This is done to make it as hard as possible for you to find that legitimate email among the mass of spam. It‚Äôll be like trying to find the needle in the haystack. It‚Äôs almost impossible to go through over 1000 emails in time to stop and cancel their order, and they take advantage of this.

Finding 1000 unread emails in your inbox, does create a sense of panic, and because of this, all logic goes out the window, which is exactly what the scammer wants. They just play with your mind to get as much time as possible to finalise their transactions.

But it‚Äôs important to keep calm and understand what‚Äôs going on.

If this happens to you, and you manage to catch it in time (if the spam hasn‚Äôt stopped yet), then you can still put a stop to them.

r/gmail,Tackling Email Overload: Strategies for Enhanced Productivity,"In the fast-paced digital landscape, email overload is a common challenge that can hinder productivity and contribute to stress. Whether you're dealing with work-related correspondence, personal messages, or a combination of both, these strategies will empower you to tackle email overload and enhance your overall productivity.

**1. Declutter Your Inbox:**

* ***Issue***: Inbox overflowing with emails.
* ***Solution***: Start by decluttering your inbox. Categorize your emails using labels for easy identification. Archive or delete irrelevant emails to keep your inbox organized.

**2. Set Email Filters:**

* ***Issue***: Difficulty in prioritizing important emails.
* ***Solution***: Take advantage of email filters to automatically sort incoming emails into relevant labels. This way, you can focus on crucial messages without being distracted by the noise of less important ones.

**3. Unsubscribe Wisely:**

* ***Issue***: Too many newsletters and promotional emails.
* ***Solution***: Unsubscribe from newsletters and promotional emails that don't add value. Keep your subscriptions to a minimum and only receive updates that genuinely interest you.

**4. Schedule Dedicated Email Time:**

* ***Issue***: Constant interruptions from incoming emails.
* ***Solution***: Set specific times during the day to check and respond to emails. Avoid constantly refreshing your inbox, allowing you to concentrate on other tasks without being interrupted by the constant ping of incoming messages.

**5. Use Email Templates:**

* ***Issue***: Spending too much time composing similar emails.
* ***Solution***: Create email templates for common responses or inquiries. This can save you time and ensure consistency in your communication.

**6. Prioritize and Flag Emails:**

* ***Issue***: Difficulty in prioritizing tasks within the inbox.
* ***Solution***: Flag or mark important emails for follow-up. Prioritize tasks by creating a to-do list within your email client, making it easier to stay organized and focused.

**7. Implement the Two-Minute Rule:**

* ***Issue***: Procrastination on quick, actionable emails.
* ***Solution***: Adhere to the two-minute rule ‚Äì if an email can be addressed within two minutes, do it immediately. This prevents a backlog of small tasks from accumulating.

**8. Unplug from Email Occasionally:**

* ***Issue***: Feeling overwhelmed by a constant influx of messages.
* ***Solution***: Schedule periods where you intentionally disconnect from your email. This could be during deep work sessions or when you need uninterrupted focus. Let colleagues know when you'll be unavailable to manage expectations.

**9. Use Email Productivity Tools:**

* ***Issue***: Inefficient email management.
* ***Solution***: Explore productivity tools designed to enhance your email experience. Tools like Boomerang, SaneBox, or Unroll.Me can help automate tasks, declutter your inbox, and improve overall efficiency.

**10. Regularly Review and Update Email Practices:**

* ***Issue***: Sticking to outdated email habits.
* ***Solution***: Regularly review your email management practices. As technology evolves, so should your strategies. Stay informed about new features in your email client and adjust your approach accordingly.

By incorporating these email management strategies into your routine, you'll be better equipped to navigate the digital deluge and maintain a productive workflow. Remember, mastering email overload is an ongoing process, so be patient and persistent. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance on your journey to a more organized digital life!

r/gmail,"Got hit with a ""Spam Bomb"" - should I be concerned?","So yesterday, I was on the receiving end of what I now understand is called a ""spam bomb"". My Gmail account suddenly started receiving hundreds and hundreds of emails from all manor of places, signing me up for newsletters and websites, etc. The emails were coming in faster than I could delete them, but I made certain to look out for any weird ones that weren't just me having been signed up for something.

It eventually petered out, but I'm still getting some here and there. What I understand from googling is that they do this in order to overwhelm your inbox with brute force, and then hope that you miss something important (like hacking into your bank or paypal, etc.) Instinctively, I changed my gmail PW, paypal as well, and checked all my bank accounts and credit cards. No suspicious activity anywhere, thankfully.

However, there were two emails that I saved because they were unique and troubling. One was a receipt for a ~$1000 MacBook Air from Apple, the other was an iPad from Best Buy, sent to someone in Hampton, VA. Like I said, I checked my bank accounts and credit cards and nothing was on any of them. I called Apple customer support, and she put a note on the purchase about it, but assured me that I could not be held liable for this purchase in any way. I got notices today that the items actually shipped, too.

So what I'm wondering is, are there any potential ramifications that I need to worry about here? Like, if they used a stolen credit card(s) to make these purchases, could the police or the credit card companies attempt to come back on me for this since my email address was used? If so, is there any way for me to head this off? Anything else to be concerned about?

r/gmail,[Question] Gmail ShuttleCloud Migration - - move copy import migrate emails account,"BACKGROUND: I have my emails in a gmail account with about 110,000 emails in it, about 14 gb according to the bar at the bottom of gmail. All of the labels were made from within Outlook. All of the labels were actually many(!) folders and subfolders in Outlook that I dragged the emails into. Therefore, in my Gmail when I'm looking at it online on PC/laptop, all of my emails are in/under these labels and none show in the Inbox in Gmail.

(ABOUT LABELS) You can do basically the same thing with Labels (I think its same?) when you make a brand new label in Gmail, you can check a checkbox to ‚ÄúNest label under:‚Äù and you pick from a dropdown which makes label folders &amp; subfolders. When working within Gmail you can label emails by clicking the label button at the top of the email and it will stay in the inbox or you can also view all emails with that label by clicking the label listed on the left. OR, you can select ‚Äúmove to‚Äù at the top of the email and move it to the new label folder, or from the inbox screen you can drag the email over to the new label folder -- both removes it from the inbox, putting the email into the label folder.

MY TASK: I am trying to find a method that will import all of the emails preserved as they are inside of their subfolders (labels) and with the correct dates and attachments, from one Gmail to another brand new Gmail account. Ideally I would love to also import my contacts (about 2000) and calendar (not much there I don‚Äôt think??).  This will be a one-time thing, I won't need future emails moved

When you sign up a new Gmail account, there's a big Get started with Gmail row across the top with 4 buttons:   
Customize your inbox,   
Change profile image,   
Import contacts and mail,   
Get Gmail for mobile

If I choose ‚Äú**Import contacts and mail**‚Äù, a popup says ‚ÄúStep 1: Sign into your other email account. What account do you want to import from? Sign into your other email account to confirm import of mail and/or contacts. Press Continue and follow the instructions in the pop-up window.‚Äù Then the next popup is ‚ÄúChoose an account to continue to Gmail ShuttleCloud Migration‚Äù. This is as far as I have gotten, then decided to search Google and ask Reddit to learn more about this. *edit*: check the boxes for items you want to import in step 2.  Step 2: Import options: Select the import options for email@XXXXX.com: \_\_ Import contacts, \_\_ Import mail, \_\_ Import new mail for next 30 days, then click Import Now.  Step 3: Finish: Your messages and contacts are being imported. It may take several hours (sometimes up to 2 days) before you start to see imported messages. You can close this window and keep using Gmail or even log out and close your browser ‚Äì we'll continue importing your mail and/or contacts in the background. To check the status of your import, look under Settings &gt; Accounts and Import.

**QUESTIONS:** Do you know anything about ShuttleCloud Migration ? Does it import everything into the new gmail basically exactly as it was in the previous gmail, preserving all dates and folders and attachments, and imports everything (*not limits like just the first 1000 emails or only 1gb or something like that*) ? Do I have to leave my computer running while it migrates or can I just log in to my new account one day and its all there ? Has anyone experienced any problems when using this ? Any idea how long 14gb as 110,000 emails will take to migrate ?

r/gmail,Distractions hurt productivity. Use the Inbox Zero Method to organize your day before you start it. Here‚Äôs how.,"Put it simply, Inbox Zero is a system that helps you sort and tackle your emails as they come in so you can spend less time on email and get things done.

Regardless if you are a student, employee, freelancer or business owner, your inbox fills each and every day. Chances are that most of your emails are simply distractions. Like that daily newsletter you stopped reading a few months ago, or maybe some product updates from an app you uninstalled last year.

All these unnecessary emails are simply interfering with your productivity.

Each and every morning I was sorting through tens of unread emails. Sometimes I would simply select all the unread emails and bulk mark them as read. Needless to say, I skipped some very important emails doing this, which made me lose money (literally).

The idea behind the Inbox Zero Method is not just to have zero emails in your inbox, but rather how you can sort through the clutter and be less distracted, which will result in higher productivity.

A study conducted by psychologists at George Mason University showed that even the smallest distractions can severely derail productivity.

In the study, students were asked to write an essay based on a prompt. At random intervals, the students were interrupted with small tasks like solving a math problem or unscrambling a word. Afterward, the students wrote another essay on a different topic, but with no distractions.

A whopping 94% of the students wrote fewer words when distracted. The quality scores of their essays, as assessed by 2 trained graders, were nearly 10% lower on average. Distractions not only made the students able to complete less work, but significantly reduced the quality of that work.

Even though you might not be a student anymore, distractions can severely affect your productivity and efficiency.

You should give the Inbox Zero Method a try even if it saves you just 10 minutes per day. Think of it this way, in a week you‚Äôll save 50 minutes, in a month you‚Äôll save more than 3 hours and in a year you‚Äôll save more than a day and a half. And this calculation is based on the assumption that you only get around 10 emails each morning. You should do the math for your inbox and see how much you could save.

In any case, implementing this method can have multiple benefits for your daily routine. There are so many different ways to go about it that it‚Äôs virtually impossible to go over all of them, but they all have these 3 things in common:

1. Unsubscribe to any marketing emails or newsletters you don't read.

2. Designate specific times for checking your email and clearing your inbox ‚Äî ideally, once in the morning and once in the evening.

3. Change your email notification settings to eliminate the time-consuming distraction that comes with being notified of new emails throughout the day.

Get started with this and you‚Äôll quickly start to feel your productivity increase.

I started doing this just a month ago and since then I started enjoying my morning a bit more. 

This method was created in 2004 so chances are some of you already know about it, I‚Äôm curious to know if anyone else has tried it.

I remembered this method by reading [this article](https://blog.superhuman.com/inbox-zero-method/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=gmail) and thought of sharing it with all of you.",7,7,2021-11-10 16:05:40,productivity,https://reddit.com/r/GMail/comments/qqv6md/distractions_hurt_productivity_use_the_inbox_zero/

I told them this was not me and they asked some more questions like if I wanted to place a temporary freeze on my account and block changing the number.  I said sure and kept the call going although this was all very sketchy cause ofc google doesn't call people?

anyways they said they wanted to send me a push notification to ""verify"" my email, which was just a notification saying someone was trying to sign into my account from New York (i do not live there lol).

After I saw that I ended the call cause it's obviously a scam.  Kinda freaked out now if there's someone or a group of scammers trying to target my email address.  I have 2FA setup on everything so I should be protected as well as I can be,  I'm thinking the next best step might be to change my email address on my log ins to important things like banks, brokers, etc to a new email that doesn't show up on haveibeenpwn'd or any other leaked database's.

r/gmail,Google Account Recovery Scam,"This is simply to inform on this and hopefully burn a number by making it easily searchable.

Summary: A Google agent calls informing that this is an account recovery verification call, and through pressure and fear tactics attempts to have the victim provide them with the recovery code that is issued via Text.

**How you know it's not Google calling you**

* GOOGLE WILL NOT CALL YOU
* Google will not change recovery details unless the *requester* can verify that *they are the owner.*
* Authentication codes are only to be used with *trusted* Google products during user-initiated security operations.
* Scammers use aggressive behavior, including pressure, fear, and blame tactics.

**My Call**

1. Agent: Informs that they are calling from Google. (From: 1-805-242-3768 -- Google Assistant)
2. Agent: Informs that they are calling to verify the recovery account details change for a Google account.
3. Agent: Informs that the original owner of the account must be verified otherwise the account recovery details change will take place.
4. Target: Asks that they phone back from a Google Phone Number.
5. Agent: Calls back. (From: 1-650-203-0000)
6. Agent: Requests that the user reply with the recovery code from the Google text to \_another\_ verification text that's the user will also have received (From: 805-242-3768).
7. Target: Upon reviewing security settings, the user cannot see any pending recovery notifications.
8. Agent: Informs that these are hidden from the user, and reiterates that if he cannot verify the user as the owner of the account, then the recovery details change will go through, and the account ""will be taken over""...
9. Target: Requests name (Marcus) and Google email (marcus.heisenberg@google.com).
10. Agent: Employs pressure and fear tactics, becoming agitated, and remarks angrily that he's just trying to help... Etc.
11. Target: Messes with them a bit more...
12. Agent: Ends call.

r/gmail,GMail is free - why do you expect paid quality of service?,"So many of the posts I see here are about support/service in response to issues.

It seems that almost every GMail user needs to be reminded that the level of support you get is in direct relation to what you're paying.

You should **NOT** be using GMail as your only email address/provider for your life-critical services (banking, etc). And if you do, BACK IT UP. There are many options available for services that will back up your GMail account.

***You backup your important data files, right*****? So, why do you leave a single point of failure for your email?**

Of course, before you all go off - I am aware that there few (if any) banks, etc that provide the ability to set multiple email addresses, but even within GMail, you can setup forwarders.

And yes, I use GMail, but I also use Workspaces, and I pay a small amount.

Do you have 2FA setup? No? Why the fuck not? Do not use SMS. Use an authenticator app. If you only use SMS, and you lose your phone then you've lost your 2FA. Any decent authenticator allows you to backup. I personally use *1Password* to generate my 2FA codes - it works on all my mobile devices and via the browser, so if I lose my phone, or it's not handy, I can get the generated codes (there's many other options than 1Password) via other means.",0,9,2025-07-02 22:23:54,productivity,https://reddit.com/r/GMail/comments/1lq4uhs/gmail_is_free_why_do_you_expect_paid_quality_of/

Sometimes I really don't like the Gmail format, and how email threads are displayed or laid out... Like why isn't the most recent response to an email chain showing at the TOP of the chain? Sometime I have to page down thru the entire email, to FIND the new response I received. Also, I notice that within my Inbox, for any given ongoing email chain, that sometimes I'll see the replying person's name/email address appearing in BOLD (which signifies, 'yes, you indeed have received a new response from this person'....but other times, that is NOT the case, and I actually have to do a SEARCH, and only then do I see that the other party actually replied to me, like a few days ago.

I just don't get why it should be so complicated....why it's not working very well.

Is it just me??

Also, I seem to recall that there may have been a category or folder that was set up by Gmail, just to hold 'reply messages', but now I don't see it...or wonder if I were imagining it. Either way, IS there a way to simply see any recent 'reply' emails from any and all people I've recently been communicating with?

r/gmail,Priority Inbox starred emails with new responses hard to find,"I'm a fan of how the ""Priority Inbox"" setting displays emails except one small issue. So it basically displays ""Important and Unread"" emails, then ""Starred"" emails, then ""Everything Else"". If I'm on an email thread where I've starred, say, the first message in the thread but there have been more messages since (none of which I've starred) all of which I've read, I've found the email is very hard to find.

I think what happens is the email thread is marked as starred, so it falls under the starred category and NOT everything else. However, within the starred portion, it only counts the timestamp of the starred message. So if the first, starred message was from a month ago, but there was a response an hour ago that I've read, the email would be stuck really far back in the starred folder, which would make it not immediately visible in this inbox (it would generally be easier to see if it wasn't starred in the first place)

r/gmail,How do I prevent Gmail from moving all emails I respond to out of my inbox? I can only find them in All Mail. Answer here.,"For a while now I've been extremely frustrated ""losing"" all the emails in my inbox after I respond to them. The only way I can see them is if I go to the All Mail box. But All Mail is, like it's name suggests, ALL mail and is overloaded with emails I've already filed or don't care about. 

I finally found the setting to avoid this. It's in settings/general tab. Look for ""Send and Archive"" option. Then check the ""Hide ""Send &amp; Archive"" button in reply option. Hit save at bottom of page.  

Toggling that switch above changes how your email replies work. I never paid attention when I was replying to emails. I simply wrote the email and then hit the Send button. Turns out that Gmail gives you two options when you are writing an email: Send or Send and Archive. You will actually see two buttons for you to choose from when you are writing an email. And the buttons do exactly what they say. 

So you can be smart and just hit the right send button and not have any problems. Me, I was just on autopilot, and needed to turn off the option so I don't have to think as hard.

Hope that helps some other people who weren't paying attention either.

r/gmail,Deleted from where?,"Here's the setup: I manage a store. The owner of the store has 3 other stores. Each store uses a separate regular gmail account, and the owner and a couple others have access to them on several devices. I have access to my store's gmail on a few devices.

Naturally, I'll occasionally check spam messages for false positives. But I also started checking the deleted items because I started noticing that legit emails were in there. Things that were business-related and needed addressing. I'm positive that I'm not doing it. I'm a die-hard archiver. I'm a hoarder who never deletes anything (unless it's spam).

I've brought it up to the person I report to, and they're certain that nobody is doing anything, but obviously that's not true.

My theory: I know that the owner of the store has an Android phone. If I remember correctly, on many versions of Android you can set the lock screen up so that swiping one way will archive an email and the other way will delete it. I'm wondering if he's swiping it and not understanding this difference. Not that I want emails archived either. I hope I'm not going to have to check all mail regularly too...

ALL of this is to ask: is there any way to check when and or where an email was deleted? I'd like to know what device was used when it was deleted. Even just the time would probably be helpful.

r/gmail,The Google photos and Gmail problem is a constant annoyance. ,"Warning. This will be a long rant about Google photos. Spare yourself and walla way unless you're annoyed too. 

The reason I'm posting this in the Gmail sub is because Gmail storage and Google photos storage are connected and Gmail keeps emailing me that my Gmail storage is almost full. Which means... If it's full... You won't get emails anymore. Ridiculous. 

To start off with, I WANT to pay them money but they offer terrible services.

Google photos is so dumb. They gave everyone free unlimited photo and video storage for years and, understandably so, they wanted people to start paying all of a sudden. That makes perfect sense as a business model and I would have been a happy customer.

The problem is that their paid service is awful. I would HAPPILY pay every month, for years, decades, for unlimited storage. 10 dollars a month? You got it. 15? Sure.

The problem is that their paid service is pay monthly, forever, for only 100gb storage.

That's like me giving you a hard drive and telling you ""Here is 100 gb. You will have to pay me for this, every month, forever.""

And it'll always only ever be 100gb. What? That's stupid. Why wouldn't I just buy my own hard drive?

I will HAPPILY pay you monthly for unlimited storage. I understand they don't want people to hoard a ton of videos (because some people are wackos) but I'd be happy with just unlimited photo storage too.

Obviously we can pay to have our favorite photos printed physically but there are some that are not worth that. We would have to completely cover our walls with all of our pictures like if we were living in the 60's trying to find out who the fuck shot Kennedy.

I like having a digital time log at my fingertips. Who wants my money for that? Anybody? Lol...

So what I'd like to go is either go to another email service that someone can recommend or find some other way to fix this problem.... Thanks. ",1,9,2024-12-17 19:24:53,hard to find,https://reddit.com/r/GMail/comments/1hgfqwi/the_google_photos_and_gmail_problem_is_a_constant/

2) I find it hard to organize my inbox and find emails that have already been read. I have opted to pop out my emails to avoid having to search for them and hoping that I can recall the subject line or email content so I can find it. However, after a day or 2 the popped out email will turn white and there is no way to restore it.. I have tried reloading, and closing the window and restoring through my history and those don't work either. Is there a setting that I can enable to restore popped out emails?

3) Are there any applications or extensions that have been helpful to you that improve your workflow and and project management tasks while using Gmail?

2. A) Once I import this Mbox file into a secondary Gmail account, will I be able to search (including Advanced criteria such as 'has words,' 'doesn't have,' date within' etc.)?

B) Will the emails appear (sender's name, subject, date) the same as they did in the primary account?

3. When I import these emails back into the primary Gmail account, will there be any indication (e.g. a stamp of some sort) that the emails were exported, if I needed to reply or forward?

r/productivity,"I cleared out an inbox of 8,000+ emails in an afternoon by searching for typical marketing phrases and words and mass deleting any emails that contained them","My inbox was at an untamable amount of clutter. I had over 8,000 emails. The problem was that some had actually useful information that I needed to save, like license codes and digital receipts. The other problem I had was that some mailing lists I otherwise like would send me junk from time to time and it was impossible to sort through it all. 

As an example of the latter, I‚Äôm on a few mailing lists for guitar-related content. Its stuff I like, but then among that were emails clogging up my inbox that I never got around to deleting because they were from a trusted sender, but were advertising for the latest course, Black Friday deal, etc.

It got overwhelming. In the past I would just sort by sender and delete emails from anyone I was no longer interested in hearing from, but I‚Äôve started to develop a better system. 

I noticed a lot of email clogging up my inbox typically had key words or phrases that would signal they were probably low value and could easily be deleted. 

It‚Äôs a work in progress, but here is that list. I‚Äôd love to hear other words or phrases I may have missed.

r/productivity,"Here Is My Productivity Mega List Of Strategies, Methods and Tactics [6min read]","Hey Hey r/productivity I've got some strategies down below. I use these ones every day, no doubt you've probably seen some floating around. 

These are the ones I use daily and hopefully there's a couple new ones in there that you'll find useful. 

I could write 10 minute pieces on each one of these to make a case but I really just wanted a post to compile them all. This is the [original article](https://medium.com/@sahkilic/my-productivity-mega-list-14-strategies-4bbb36e650e6) I wrote if you want to support it on Medium. But its all here too! Enjoy and let me know if it helped!

**1 | The Morning Memo**

At the end of every day, set out a small but substantial goal for the next day and regardless of what you do the next day, you have to complete that task. Whatever else happens that day, you will have achieved something.

**2 | The 3 Second Rule**

Force your survival instinct to kick in while you leave your analytical mind behind. If you know you need to do something, count to 3 and do it. After you get to 0, you have to do it, otherwise this rule will never work for you again. This rule will force you to throw away all the time you will have otherwise spent talking yourself out of it or procrastinating. It's basic, it's simple and seems like an ill thought throwaway 'rule'. I promise it's not, try it.

**3 | Hardest Thing First**

Tackling the hardest part of your day, as the first thing you do in the day will make the rest of your day oh so smooth. Everything will come effortlessly and you'll be exponentially more productive, able to keep the momentum going when each task get's easier and easier.

**4 | Divide And Conquer**

The trouble with productivity or lack there of, is trying to take something huge and tackle it head on. This will almost always be so daunting that you will resort to procrastination. If you divide up the work into more digestible chunks, you'll be able to bring yourself to do the work and one step at a time, finish the previously gargantuan task.

**5 | Effort Management and Delegation**

You have 1000 effort points a day. You want to spend all those effort points on the things that matter. Let's say the optimal task to spend a single effort point on brings you $1. If task X takes 200 effort points (1/5 of your daily limit or $200 in potential value) but it only costs you $100 to get someone else to do it, then just delegate and don't do the task yourself. Spend the effort on what matters, delegate smaller tasks. Logically it makes perfect sense, practically, we all neglect it.

**6 | Rubber Duck Debugging**

You have a problem that you're working through in your head, the issue with that is, things in your head can get a little complex and muddled. This causes you to hit an all time productivity low. You have a persistent problem and it's hard to work through. To fix this, you get a rubber duck and explain the problem to the rubber duck. This helps you verbalise the problem and most of the time, when you verbalise it by using actual communication, you tend to fix the problem. (you don't really need to use a rubber duck, an inanimate object or disinterested friend is ok too)

**7 | The Knowledge Card Trick**

Sticky notes, Trello, a whiteboard‚Ä¶ something. Getting tasks from head to paper is a fantastic way to de-clutter the mind. There's no better way of getting things done than actually knowing what needs to be done. And make no mistake, even though those tasks are in your head somewhere, you tend to not know about it until it's facing you in the 'To-Do' column in Trello. Bonus points if you stick a deadline on each task, this does a lot of preventative work. What are we preventing you ask? A never ending To-Do List I answer.

**8 | The Marathon vs Sprint**

You should put maximum effort into not relying on motivation. I love motivational and eye-opening quotes from better people but that doesn't exactly help me. Neither I or you or anyone will achieve their goals from random sporadic moments of motivation followed by a decline in effort. Avoid going cold turkey on bad habits and avoid going all in on good habits. You aren't a switch, you're a human and you need to condition yourself by making small changes that will eventually turn into big results.

**9 | The Community Architect**

The old adage of ""you're the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with"" has a lot of truth to it. We're social creatures and as intrinsically valued as we might be, we will always look for external validation, competition and support among other things. If you're a hustler that hangs out with drones, your hustling won't improve, won't be appreciated and feeling out of place might put you in a state of mind that won't be healthy for anyone, least of all yourself. You're the architect of your own community, make sure you spend extra care when picking your friends.

**10 | Steam, Serenity, Sports and Sex**

You're not a robot and neither is anyone else. You can't be expected to or can't expect perfection and pure productivity of yourself. So put away that guilt because I know you feel it. Everyone needs to blow off steam, meditate one way or another, keep physically active and get physical as much as possible. These things aren't a luxury, they're requirements. If you still feel guilty, treat it like maintenance, because that's what it is.

**11 | The False Substitute**

I hate Gary Vaynerchuk. Not because he's a bad guy‚Ää-‚Äähe's not, not because his content isn't valuable‚Ää-‚Äähe's got great tips, and not because of that aura of arrogance. You know, the usual reasons why people aren't a fan. I hate Gary because whether it's intentional or not, an army of aspiring entrepreneurs neglect sleep and substitute it for work because of his content. Look, If you need 8 hours, don't do 6. You don't need to do 6. Getting 2 extra hours at the expense of losing quality for every other hour in your day is just no worth it. It's a false substitute. I need 7‚Äì8 hours of sleep for maximum on-the-ball time. You best bet that I'm taking those hours. If you can have maximum on-the-ball time with 5‚Äì6 hours, power to you sir and/or madam. If a 'hustler' laughs at you for sleeping 8 hour nights, crack a smile and move on.

**12 | 15 Minute Self Care Routine**

Every day, I block out time for deliberate and focused self care. Making my bed, tidying my desk, shaving and showering. I've found that I can't fully take care of tasks and problems throughout the day, if I don't respect myself enough to spend some time on myself. It doesn't have to be over the top, it doesn't have to be huge. Making it deliberate and focusing on only that will be enough to build up a small routine with huge dividends. If you haven't walked into a tidy work space, or ended the day by retreating into a tidy bedroom, give it a try.

**13 | Social Media Trading Hours**

Delete all social media applications from your phone, and have a designated time in the day to check these on your desktop/laptop. You can try setting the schedule and being disciplined enough to not look at them until the time comes but bare in mind‚Ä¶ Top apps tend to be owned by companies worth billions of dollars, and they tend to invest quite a bit of time and money to make you an addict through behavioral triggers and complex algorithms, neatly packed into smart UX design. Get rid of them and enjoy the extra hour in your day that you magically created.

**14 | Fear Deconstruction**

If your productivity in relation to new undertakings, and general progression to more fulfilling things has ever been hindered, you can blame fear. Starting a new workout regimen, trying a new diet, taking a new class are all productive. But fear of the most mundane sort will take over and stop you from doing these things. Physically write down every fear you have relating to the action. You'll find that writing them down and taking a moment to read will help you realise how ridiculous some of these fears are, eventually allowing you to work through them.

r/productivity,I tried 10+ productivity tools‚Ä¶ then deleted most of them. These 3 are all I really needed.,"I literally tried everything ‚Äî Notion, Todoist, Calendly... half a dozen AI tools that promised to ‚Äúoptimize my flow‚Äù or whatever‚Ä¶

But the more tools I added, the more cluttered my workspace got. My brain just felt *louder*.



So a couple weeks ago I rage-quit my whole setup and asked:

What‚Äôs the *minimum* I can use and still get stuff done without burning out?



Here‚Äôs what I ended up keeping:



1. **Apple Notes**  I swear this thing is so underrated. It‚Äôs on every device, dead simple, and fast.I just started organizing my notes a little better ‚Äî using spacing, line breaks, and little emojis as section markers. Suddenly it feels like my brain is organized. I can jot something down on my phone and it‚Äôs there on my Mac without thinking.



1. **Google Calendar**Yes, I hate it. Yes, I use it every day. My team‚Äôs on it, clients are on it, so I can‚Äôt ditch it.But coordinating across time zones, or with people using Outlook/Apple, still drives me nuts. so I needed something to help me *use* Google Calendar without living in it.



1. **Ada Calendar (Chrome extension)**This is a tiny plugin I found that basically acts like a translator between the chaos and my calendar.Someone sends me a meeting time in Slack or email, and I screenshot it , Ada parses it ‚Üí adds to my GCal in the right time zone.I also paste my to-dos or meeting notes from Apple Notes, and it handles the calendar part.It‚Äôs not a calendar ‚Äî it‚Äôs just a little helper that makes Google Calendar suck less.



I realized I don‚Äôt need a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù system. I just need tools that don‚Äôt demand attention and quietly solve real problems.

This combo works for me now: simple, synced, and low-friction.

r/productivity,I replaced social media with Office 365 and changed my life,"I deactivated or deleted all of my social media accounts and then purchased a premium subscription of Office 365. 

I now work on the mantra that if someone wants to be in my life, they'll find a way to be a part of it. They'll call me or they'll visit me if they're in the local area. If not, then they didn't care that much in the first place.

---

What did I do?

1. My email is given to very specific people and I only use it for certain services
2. I use the calendar in Outlook to schedule/plan everything - business/personal
3. I use OneNote to keep notes for business ideas, healthy recipes, etc.
4. I use OneDrive to keep documents and photos that I want to share with family/friends
5. I use Microsoft Flow so all attachments received by email are saved in OneDrive automatically
6. I use Excel to track my weight and make notes on my mood each day - a simple row for each day
7. I schedule time every single day to motivate myself each morning - it's part of the routine like showering

---

What have been the benefits?

1. My time is a lot easier to manage and it's easier to keep track of things - my schedule is solid
2. I've lost roughly 30kg in weight since starting to track what I eat - I'm now on a ketogenic diet
3. My inbox is less cluttered and easier to manage without those notifications related to social media
4. When I meet people I give a damn about then I have a real connection with them and it's interesting
5. Gaining knowledge to go ketogenic has helped manage the health issues I have far more than any medicine
6. I have a completely different outlook on life - sometimes it's just nice to observe and appreciate the little things
7. I no longer subconsciously compare myself to others on social media - I decide my life, you decide yours
8. My life is now a mystery to people I meet up with - they don't have constant insight into it so I'm more interesting
9. The lack of exposure to all the negative news on social media has improved my mood/outlook - I can't change the world but I can change me and what I do and make the world fractionally a better place for it

r/productivity,Results from my ‚ÄúOutput Only. No Input‚Äù Experiment,"In an attempt to improve in a different way (after already minimizing physical possessions + improving my diet and getting to a healthy weight). I've done a \~1 week ""consumption input"" minimization experiment.



See my original post on my blog or on my post history here.

**Original post TLDR:** try to only output things without looking anything up, not even the definition of a word. no inputs/consumption. no studying or pulling up references. just raw creation &amp; meditation.

So after doing this for about a week. I am still adjusting but see some positives already &amp; also some negatives.

I often need to pull up references or look things up to be sure I am not getting anything ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. A sort of insidious habit that can disguise itself as helpful but is just another blocker to creating.

After doing a few days of this no input, only output. Just creating based on instinct and what I myself thought was ‚Äúright‚Äù: mistakes-galore here we come.

I was able to instead of trying to look everything up (to be closer to ‚Äúperfection/the-right-way‚Äù), I more or less just went with my gut.

And sometimes, though admittedly not always, I found concepts I thought I did NOT remember, but if I waited &amp; i thought a bit harder, I kinda DID remember. kinda like dusting off old books that were stored way in the back, almost completely forgotten. The rest I more or less made up as I went along. what would i formulate for myself if there was no answers in the book?

Trusting in myself that I already ‚Äúknew enough‚Äù, that I had so much within that I was in some odd way suppressing was my thesis going in.

What does it really mean to ‚Äúknow something‚Äù anyhow?

At times it was quite difficult and I was weak and did ease up some of my rules. I allowed myself to read on a long airplane ride, check my email daily to keep it clean (but my emails has luckily mostly already been reduced to mostly essentials), briefly communicate with loved ones, and look at comments/stats of my past post(s).

i think reading books (especially high quality ones) is a good balance, but perhaps limiting to just one or two books for x days would be wiser &amp; provide a happier balance. i still need to experiment more. one positive side effect is that for me personally it lessens my inhibition to create &amp; share what i‚Äôve made. still not 100% but much better than before. even if i‚Äôm just mostly dumping ‚Äútrash‚Äù i prefer this to my past method of just wishing one day I would do X or Y. there were many ramblings and recurring themes that kept popping into my crazy hectic mind but one i forgot over and and over again and have to still remind myself of: i‚Äôm not that important anyway, most of what i create doesn‚Äôt matter. and yet it does to me so that‚Äôs reason enough. perfection is an illusion.

even though like probably most of us, i detest the sound of my own voice, i really have started to get over it and even enjoy listening to my own ramblings. creating almost like a feedback loop that normally would only happen in my own mind but now I can go a little bit deeper. my main ‚Äúoutput‚Äù has oddly been voice recordings. never woulda guess this would be the case.

however, part of me is somewhat doubtful this is healthy long term. listening to your own voice over &amp; over again might be the definition of madness. mental health is a concern especially since the nature of long-term solo travel is already a bit isolating. but part of me knows something was missing from my past ‚Äúroutine‚Äù. maybe I will keep playing around with periods of doing this and taking a break and repeating the cycle.

one weird annoyance i am still struggling with is how to ‚Äúdump‚Äù all this stuff out to the internet in a more streamlined manner so i can feel a bit of relief in just getting it out there. for the most part i‚Äôve been relying on you-tube and wordpress (personal blog). i guess part of me still feels some of my stuff Is ‚Äúcluttering‚Äù the rest (namely one off images, short music loops, etc) , but perhaps that is a limiting belief of it‚Äôs own that I need to break free from.

r/productivity,I (think I) know my needs. I'm overwhelmed by options.,"I am a teacher, and I'm trying to get a handle on my workload. I just spent the better part of the day reading this sub and investigating different organizational options. I am so overwhelmed, and I have nothing to show for my time. Maybe someone can suggest a platform/resource/app for my needs.

Top Priority:

* a simple to do list function with the ability to create categories (Inbox, Today, This Week, etc.) that I'll check on a daily basis
* a place to keep ideas that aren't really actionable (these are usually links to websites and accompanying notes but nothing elaborate) that is really just a place for me to save good teaching resources so they don't clutter up my brain or to do list.

Nice to have, but not a dealbreaker:

* the ability to make a weekly plan (I like what I saw on Notion when I was checking that out today)

That's really it. I don't need to share with others. I don't need to integrate with a calendar (I use Outlook for my email/calendar and have a paper planner for lesson plans). I don't expect to use it for projects where I'm breaking things down into many subtasks. 

First I used Google Tasks, and I was happy with it. The problem was I used it for both ""to do list"" items and ""ideas to remember,"" and it got unwieldy. I think I need to keep these separated. Google Tasks was working great for me for to do list purposes, but somewhere along the line I read that Google Keep is better, so I set that up, but without really understanding what it is for (I know, stupid). I thought it would work for my ""ideas to remember needs,"" but it is kind of driving me crazy. I think I just wasted the day misunderstanding what Google Keep is meant for. 

For the ideas/resources need, I am realizing that my brain likes columns/categories. I just want to be able to create columns for the courses I teach like ""American History,"" ""World History,"" and ""Government,"" and then drop ideas and links in a list under those headings. I don't really want to get into tags and labels or whatever. As far as I can tell, Google Keep won't let me hyperlink text, and so I have long urls in there, which is annoying. I probably would be fine with Google Tasks for my to do list and something like Padlet for the teaching ideas and resources, but I would prefer a ""one-stop"" shop for these 2-3 needs. Is Notion the answer? Todoist? I feel like what I want is so simple, and most of these options do way more than I need. Maybe I'm wrong. I'd be grateful for suggestions.",4,2,2025-01-12 22:55:51,email cluttered,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1hzwq15/i_think_i_know_my_needs_im_overwhelmed_by_options/

I am on medical leave now and am trying to use this time to try to... minimize digital clutter and noise and also do things like, create a new bedtime routine with my husband where we don't have our phones. I want less information coming to me daily.

Does anyone have recommendations for reducing digital clutter and noise? Or even things like, how to still get important phone calls but not have your phones with you in the room at night? Like... should we get a landline?

r/productivity,Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport ‚Äì Notes and Summary,"*Note: These notes are ones that I personally found value in. This is not an exhaustive summary. I may have left out some segments that I thought were not relevant to me.*

&gt; Services that seem indispensable are often providing nothing more than convenient hits of distraction.

&gt; Digital Minimalism ‚Äì Cal Newport

&amp;nbsp;

**Introduction**

There are numerous philosophies about how to interact with the digital world. These philosophies explain what tools you should use, how you should use them, and what to ignore.

Digital Minimalism applies the belief that less can be more to our relationship with digital tools.

The goal of this book is to make the case for digital minimalism and then teach you how to adopt this philosophy if you decide it‚Äôs right for you.

You‚Äôll leave all optional online activities for 30 days. Then, you will intentionally introduce a select few activities that you believe will provide massive benefit to the things you value. 

&amp;nbsp; 

    Part 1 ‚Äì Foundations

&amp;nbsp;

**Chapter 1 ‚Äì A Lopsided Arms Race**

Initially, people did not expect to be spending so long on Facebook and their phones when these things were first released. We appear to have stumbled backwards into it (or been pushed into it by large companies investing a ton of money to make this outcome inevitable).

Companies design their technologies to be used in particular ways for long periods of time because that‚Äôs how they make money.

Adam Alter (psychologist) goes on to describe users as ‚Äúgambling‚Äù every time they post something on a social media platform: Will you get likes (or hearts or retweets), or will it languish with no feedback? This unpredictability of outcome makes the activity of posting more appealing.

Essentially, companies exploit behavioural addictions to get people to use their services. They gain money at the cost of our well being.

&amp;nbsp;


**Chapter 2 ‚Äì Digital Minimalism**

Digital Minimalism ‚Äì A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.

**Why Digital Minimalism is effective**

* Clutter is costly
 * Cluttering time and attention with too many devices, apps, and services creates an overall negative cost that can swamp the small benefits that each individual item provides in isolation.
  * Clutter is dangerous because it‚Äôs easy to be seduced by the small amounts of profit offered by the latest app or service, but then forget its cost in terms of your time.

* Optimization is important
 * Deciding whether a particular technology supports your values is the first step. It is necessary to think carefully about how you‚Äôll use the technology

* Intentionality is satisfying

 * Digital minimalists derive significant satisfaction from their general commitment to being more intentional about how they engage with new technologies. This source of satisfaction is independent of the specific decisions they make.
 * The very act of being selective about your tools will bring you satisfaction, typically much more than what is lost from the tools you decide to avoid.

&amp;nbsp;


**Chapter 3 - The Digital Declutter**

1. Put aside a 30 day period during which you will take a break from optional technologies in your life.

2. During this break, explore and rediscover activities and behaviours that you find satisfying and meaningful.

3. At the end of the break, reintroduce optional technologies into your life, starting from a blank state. For each technology you reintroduce, determine what value it serves in your life and how specifically you will use it so as to maximise this value.

  1. Does the technology support something that you deeply value?
  2. Is this technology the best way to support you value?
  3. How are you going to use this technology going forward to maximise its value and minimise its harms?

&amp;nbsp;


    Part 2 ‚Äì Practices

&amp;nbsp;

**Chapter 4 -Spend Time Alone**

Solitude is beneficial, as it allows you to be with your own thoughts. Solitude deprivation, where we have little time to spend with our own thoughts away from the inputs of other minds, has become widespread.

Smartphones have likely caused the rise of a generation‚Äôs mental health issues. We need solitude to thrive as human beings, and in recent years, without even realising it, we‚Äôve been systematically reducing this crucial ingredient from our lives.

Go on long walks on your own with no external stimulation to invoke your thoughts and reflections.

&amp;nbsp;


**Chapter 5 ‚Äì Don‚Äôt Click ‚ÄúLike‚Äù**

Humans are instinctively wired to think about social life in their down time.

The ‚Äòdefault network‚Äô, a part of the brain, activates whenever no specific task is being accomplished. i.e it activates in your down time.

Real world interactions produce far more value than social media. Some studies have shown that social media use may be responsible for poor mental health.

Replacing face to face interactions with mere ‚Äòlikes‚Äô is the equivalent of towing a Ferrari behind a mule.

Liking and leaving meaningless comments should be stopped, as it encourages connection as a reasonable alternative to conversation.

Keep your phone in Do Not Disturb mode and have fixed times to go through your texts and respond to them. Treat texts like emails, not an ongoing conversation throughout the day.

Talk to people more often.

Find a regular time (e.g during a busy commute) and advertise that time as an opportunity for anybody to call or come see you.

&amp;nbsp;

**Chapter 6 ‚Äì Reclaim Leisure**

By cultivating a high quality leisure life first, it will become easier to minimise low-quality digital diversions later.

The mind does not require rest (except in sleep), but change.

The value of a pursuit is often proportional to the energy invested.

To fully extract the benefits of craft in your free time, seek it in its analog forms.

Learn a new physical skill every week for six weeks.

* Leisure Lesson #1: Prioritise demanding activity over passive consumption.
* Leisure Lesson #2: Use Skills to produce valuable things in the physical world
* Leisure Lesson #3: Seek activities that require real-world, structured social interactions.

&amp;nbsp;

**Schedule in advance the time you spend on low quality leisure (e.g leisure that is engineered to distract you ‚Äì most social media)**

* When the scheduled time arrives, do whatever you want (binge Netflix or scroll through Reddit.)
* This allows you to not completely abandon low quality activities, and leave opportunity outside the scheduled time for more substantial activities.
* Initially, you can start with large chunks of your day scheduled for low quality leisure, but as you integrate high quality leisure activities into your day, you will gradually lower the amount of time spent on low quality leisure. Eventually, most people are able to get the most value by using social media for 20 to 40 minutes per week.

&amp;nbsp;

**Incorporate a seasonal and weekly leisure plan**

The Seasonal Leisure Plan

* It is a semiannual plan (3 or 4 times a year, up to you)
* Involves objectives and habits that you plan to honour in the upcoming season.
* Objectives describe the specific goals you plan to accomplish, accompanied by the strategies for how you will accomplish them.
* Habits describe behaviour rules you plan to stick with throughout the season.
* The objectives and habits will both be connected to cultivating a high quality leisure life.

The Weekly Lesiure Plan

* Review your seasonal plan every week, and plan your week in detail to ensure you work towards your objectives.
* Do not see these plans as some sort of optional endevaour, but rather, as part of your normal scheduling.
* Review your previous week‚Äôs habits to reflect on them and identify any issues that may need resolving.

People who become intentional in their leisure ten to find more of it in their life.

Doing nothing as a form of relaxing may seem enticing, but ultimately the rewards are muted and the fulfilment is lacking. Instead, investing your energy into something hard but worthwhile almost always returns much richer rewards.

&amp;nbsp;


**Chapter 7 ‚Äì Join the Attention Resistance**

This chapter outlines steps you can take to maximise the value you extract from services that are intended to hold your attention for long periods of time.

* Delete social media from your phone
  * Most of the revenue for companies are generated through their mobile apps ‚Äì so their engineers spend more time optmising them to gain your attention.
  * Access the services through a desktop computer.
* Utilise blocking software on your phones and computer to block distracting low value websites that you often visit.
* Develop a plan for your use case of social media to ‚Äòmaximise good information and cut out the waste‚Äô.

&amp;nbsp;

**Conclusion**

Implementing the philosophy of digital minimalism is largely an exercise in pragmatism. Digital minimalists see new technologies as tools to be used to support things they deeply value ‚Äì not as sources of value themselves.

r/productivity,**Boost Your Productivity with a Teletubby Twist: The 2-Minute Rule**,"Feeling overwhelmed by your to-do list? Let‚Äôs infuse some Teletubby magic into your productivity routine. Inspired by the Teletubbies' cheerful approach to life, the **2-Minute Rule** can help you tackle tasks with the same playful efficiency.

**What is the 2-Minute Rule?**

The 2-Minute Rule is simple: if a task can be completed in two minutes or less, do it immediately. Imagine it as responding to the Teletubbies‚Äô excitement when they spot Tubby Custard‚Äîa delicious, gooey pink treat that brings them joy and energy. Like their spontaneous delight, handle quick tasks without delay.

**Why It Works:**

1. **Reduces Procrastination:** Just as the Teletubbies instantly react to the sight of Tubby Custard, which makes them eager to dive in, tackling small tasks immediately keeps procrastination at bay. No task should linger like a forgotten Tubby Custard.

2. **Boosts Momentum:** Completing small tasks creates a sense of achievement, similar to the Teletubbies‚Äô glee when they play with their Tubby Custard. Each little victory fuels your motivation for larger tasks.

3. **Clears Your Mind:** By swiftly handling minor tasks, you prevent them from cluttering your mental space. Think of it as the Teletubbies‚Äô clean and colorful world, where everything is organized and cheerful, thanks to their swift reactions to delightful things.

**How to Implement the 2-Minute Rule:**

1. **Spot Quick Tasks:** Identify tasks that take two minutes or less, like responding to an email or tidying up a small area. Picture these tasks as quick, satisfying moments of Tubby Custard enjoyment, where immediate action is both simple and rewarding.

2. **Act Immediately:** When you encounter a quick task, handle it right away. Just like the Teletubbies eagerly dive into their Tubby Custard, don‚Äôt let these tasks sit on your list.

3. **Review Your Wins:** At the end of the day, reflect on how many small tasks you‚Äôve accomplished. It‚Äôs akin to the Teletubbies feeling content and happy after enjoying their Tubby Custard and reflecting on their day‚Äôs joy.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Combine with Time Blocking:** Use the 2-Minute Rule alongside time blocking for larger projects. This way, you handle small tasks efficiently while focusing on big goals, much like how the Teletubbies balance their fun and structured routines.

- **Stay Consistent:** Make the 2-Minute Rule a daily habit. Just as the Teletubbies enjoy their routine of Tubby Custard and playful activities, consistently applying this rule helps integrate it into your productivity habits.

By embracing the 2-Minute Rule with the enthusiasm of the Teletubbies enjoying their Tubby Custard, you‚Äôll find your productivity improving with joyful ease.

r/productivity,Can't concentrate? How to set up your work environment to eliminate distractions and maximize focus (A Guide),"You‚Äôve finally beat procrastination and forced yourself to sit down at your desk to do the important work you‚Äôve been putting off that requires your full concentration.

You begin‚Äîand within seconds you‚Äôre distracted with something. Your mind wanders. You just can‚Äôt focus. Again.

You‚Äôre so discouraged and assume you have some sort of attention deficit issue.¬†

But in truth you probably just keep putting yourself in a compromised work environment.

&gt;""Even when you realize how much your environment is shaping you, it's still shaping you more than you realize."" - Nick Milo

Your environment has a big impact on your thoughts, mood, decisions, actions and behaviours. It's why restaurants and retailers spend massive amounts of money creating the right vibe to alter how their customers feel (and hopefully spend).

What‚Äôs great about engineering your environment for improved concentration is you don‚Äôt need to develop any new skills. In fact, you don't need to do anything better; you‚Äôre just setting up guardrails that prevent you from doing dumb stuff like checking your phone in the middle of working. By taking these simple steps, you'll feel like you're on a powerful nootropic. Like you‚Äôve been granted a superpower.



# Your environments

*Note that I talk mainly about doing deeply focused work (aka* ***deep work****) in this post, but the advice applies to school studies just as well.*

When discussing environment, I like to break it down into three kinds: **physical space**, **workspace**, and **work device**.

There are a lot of variables at play in your overall environment. Are you working from home or an office? Is the environment noisy (coffee shop chatter; your kids running around at home) or quiet? What kind of work or studies are you doing? What space and resources do you have access to around you? Essentially it all comes down to how much control you have over your environment. For this discussion, I'm going to assume you're working from home and can control your environment to a large degree.¬†

Two important things to note before we begin: when doing deep work, give yourself a start time and plan out your environment so that everything‚Äôs ready in advance of that start time. Don't just gradually start your morning and begin working whenever you‚Äôre all set up and feeling ready (because you‚Äôll find ways to stall and procrastinate). Set a time in your calendar and commit to starting on time. Treat it like an important meeting you‚Äôre leading. You wouldn't begin prepping for the meeting once it starts; you'd have everything ready to go prior to its start.

Alright, let‚Äôs get going.



# Physical space

Your physical space is the room you're working in. This could be in your home, your office, coffee shop, library, or outside.



**Different space for deep work**

Ideally, you'd do your deeply focused work in a space different from your regular work or where you do more administrative tasks. Doing this will provide cues to your mind that this work is important and needs special attention. So, if possible, try a different room or area of your home to do this work. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a permanent setup; it could be as simple as using the kitchen table for your deep work session if you normally work from a cluttered desk in the bedroom.



**Walls not windows**

It's better to have your desk face a wall than a window. You might think looking out a bright window at some nature is calming and provides inspiration, but it's really just a distraction when working deeply. I know, staring at a wall sounds painfully boring‚Äîand that‚Äôs the point.



**Temperature**

If you're able to control the temperature of your environment, consider how it feels. Are you too hot? Too cold? What can you do to adjust the temperature (or your clothes) before you start working so that it doesn't become a distraction after you start?¬†



*Tip: Wear layers so it‚Äôs easy to take something off or throw something on without having to do a whole wardrobe change. Just make sure these layers are either on you or nearby.*



**Music**

If planning to listen to music, have your headphones ready and the music selected before your start time. It‚Äôs recommended to listen to music without vocals, as studies show hearing music with a voice distracts us more than music without. Research also suggests that the most productive type of music to listen to while focusing is music that sounds familiar and is relatively simple. Note that 'familiar' is relative.



*Tip: Use 40hz binaural beats to prime your brain leading up to your session but not throughout the entirety of your session.*



**Take stock of objects in your environment**

Environmental cues‚Äîseemingly innocuous things in our space, like books or pictures hanging on the wall‚Äîdon't actively disrupt us like notifications do, but they can still pull us away from what we intend to accomplish. So it's best to remove as many visual cues as you can in advance before doing deep work.

Take stock of the objects in your environment and identify which ones may attract your attention. Then clear these. Note that there are some objects which can be beneficial, like plants. But generally, the more complex the object, the more it will pull you into distraction. This is another reason to have your desk face the wall rather than a window or overlooking your physical space.

*Remember: It's significantly easier to deal with distractions in advance. Once they appear, it's often too late to stop them.*



# Workspace

Your workspace includes the surface you‚Äôre working on (desk, table) and what you‚Äôre sitting in (or standing on if you‚Äôre a fellow stander).



**Clear clutter**

The more clutter on your workspace, the more clutter in your mind. A clear desk to do deep work from will ensure there‚Äôs nothing waiting to pull at your attention.

Remove everything from your desk that you don't need for this specific session. Books, notes, YOUR PHONE, everything. Question everything.



**De-device yourself**

Take off your smartwatch and turn it and your phone off. Seriously, don‚Äôt just put things on silent. Turn them off. Your mind will know the difference.

Now put both devices (as well as tablets and any other devices you have) in another room, if possible. Or at least put them in a purse or bag. They need to be both out of sight and out of reach. We're more likely to check our phone more frequently when we can see it‚Äîeven if it isn't buzzing or ringing. Research also shows that merely having your phone in your visual field interferes with concentration; it subtly, almost imperceptibly, pulls at your attention‚Äîand you‚Äôre then forced to expend mental resources to fight this.¬†



**Don't work with food on your desk**

Do you snack while you work? It can be comforting, but it‚Äôs also habit-forming. And you might think it‚Äôs not distracting, but it usually is. Maybe you spill something on your keyboard, or your fingers get sticky and you need to wipe them, or you get a piece of food stuck in your teeth that you‚Äôre now wrestling with. All these things happen and we barely notice them, but they add up to the enemy: distraction.¬†



**Do work with drinks on your desk**

Before you start, make sure you've prepared fluids to stay hydrated. Definitely have water, but you may also want coffee or tea. Whatever it is, just have it ready on your desk so it doesn‚Äôt become an excuse to take an unscheduled break to go get something.



**Comfort**

Ensure you‚Äôre comfortable, whether sitting or standing. Ask yourself, Is there anything I can do right now to be more physically comfortable? How‚Äôs your chair height? Your footwear? Physical discomfort can quickly turn into distraction.



**Use a distraction catcher**

Keep a pen and piece of paper on your desk and within reach so you can jot down anything that pops into your head that‚Äôs unrelated to the task at hand. Maybe you just remembered you have yoga class after work and you forgot to add it to your calendar. Quickly capture it on paper instead of opening up your calendar or, worse, trying to keep it in your head until you‚Äôre done (which will take up cognitive resources and prove very distracting). Once you write it down, you‚Äôll be free to keep working without worry that it‚Äôll get missed.

*Tip: also jot down things that distracted you during the session (whether from your external environment or your internal one) so you can think about how to improve next time.*



# Work device

So far, you've attentioneered your physical space and your workspace. Turn now to your work device. This could be a desktop, laptop, tablet or a notebook and pencil (it could also be your phone but this should be avoided at all costs. Please please try to find another way to do your work than from your phone).

I'm going to assume you're working on a computer.



**Gather resources**

Download things you need to do your work from apps like Slack, Drive, or email so you‚Äôre not opening them in the middle of your session to get something only to get distracted by something else.

Do this well in advance of your session. Like, the day before, if possible. Doing it in advance is important for two reasons: (1) if you notice there‚Äôs something you can‚Äôt find or your colleague sent you the wrong file, it gives you time to track it down; (2) you don‚Äôt spend the minutes leading up to your work session frantically jumping from app to app and putting your mind in a frenzied state.



**Shut it all down**

Shut down all apps and tabs that you won‚Äôt be using during the session. If you think you may use an app, better to shut it down ahead of time and open it later if needed.

If you do open an app or website to work on, immediately close it once you're done. Don't leave it open (Closing apps and tabs right after use is a great habit in general that I recently developed; it really helps keep me on task throughout the day).

All messaging apps on your work device need to be fully shut down, not just have notifications turned off.

*Tip: Have your tasks listed out on paper ahead of time and beside you so you don't even need to keep your task manager app open.*



# A word of warning

That was a lot to cover. And you might be thinking, *This is a lot to do! Is it really all necessary? How will I ever focus at a coffee shop or the office where I have less control over the environment?*

Two things come to mind: (1) a lot of what I‚Äôve covered will become second nature once you do it a few times. Personally, I have a simple checklist I use to keep the process quick; (2) this guide is for those who have trouble focusing under any circumstances. The purpose of setting up an ideal environment is so you can first learn how to concentrate with as little friction as possible.

Once you develop this skill in an ideal environment (and you also master internal distractions, which I'll talk about more another time), you can slowly start to introduce some distractions back in.¬†

The ultimate goal is not to have your concentration hinge on having a perfectly meditative space and be unable to work if there's the slightest distraction. That makes you fragile. You want to become antifragile. You want the ability to maintain laser-sharp focus for several hours in a bustling cafe without headphones. That‚Äôs the goal.

So, at the beginning you'll want to be kind to yourself and make it easier by eliminating as many distractions as possible. And this will take some time to get right.

But eventually, with practice, you'll become less worried about distractions. They'll simply have less hold on you. They'll be less enticing. And you'll be unstoppable.",14,1,2024-05-12 14:54:46,email cluttered,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1cq6697/cant_concentrate_how_to_set_up_your_work/
r/productivity,Daily/Weekly Planning Apps or Software,"I tend to be very forgetful and am easily distracted, so I find I need very rigid structure to ensure I'm being productive with my days. As such, I figured if I had my day/week planned out better I'd be far more likely to do the things I wanted/needed to do. I'm pretty financially strapped atm so subscriptions of basically any kind are pretty much off the table unless it's literally impossible to get the functionality I need without it. I have an iphone and that would be the most convenient place for me to have my tdls and such, so a daily planner app of some sort available on ios would be the ideal.

Some functions I was looking for were listing a task for a specific period of time (From 7am-8am could be my workout block as an example). Being able to add every day tasks that apply universally, or are on the same day every week so I don't need to add something like \*do laundry\* every Friday or \*eat breakfast\* to every individual day/time slot (assuming I eat breakfast at the same time every day). Ability to add a list of tasks to do that do not necessarily need to be completed during a certain time (Do taxes, check your email, schedule an appointment, etc) that I can just check every so often when I have free time, and chip away at. Color coordination for separating task types would be super nice but not a necessity. Easy to use UI, not too cluttered, and the ability to add notifications is also a plus. I prefer something simple as long as it has the functionality I need.

For anyone wondering, I find the default ios calendar too tedious and lacking on features to be sufficient for my intended purpose.

All suggestions are appreciated. I'm really not sure if these features even make sense for my purposes or if it's even possible to get these things on a free app, so feel free to let me know if I'm expecting too much.

As a side note I'm also looking for something to keep track of recipes/meal plans and workout tracking so throw that in as well if you have it.",2,2,2024-05-08 20:12:47,email cluttered,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1cn9w5a/dailyweekly_planning_apps_or_software/
r/productivity,The Power of the Two-Minute Rule in Productivity,"Discover the power of the two-minute rule in boosting productivity. Learn how this simple strategy can help manage tasks efficiently, reduce procrastination, and streamline your workflow.  
  
In the quest for peak productivity, various strategies and methods have been devised, but few are as straightforward and immediately impactful as the two-minute rule. This simple yet effective principle posits that if a task can be done in two minutes or less, it should be done immediately. Originating from David Allen‚Äôs Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology, the two-minute rule serves as a practical approach to task management, helping individuals reduce procrastination, manage tasks more efficiently, and maintain a smooth workflow.

&amp;#x200B;

**Understanding the Two-Minute Rule**  
The essence of the two-minute rule is to make quick decisions on actions as they arise and immediately complete those tasks that are estimated to take two minutes or less. This approach helps in several ways. It prevents small tasks from accumulating into a daunting backlog, keeps your workspace and mind clear, and provides a sense of accomplishment that can boost motivation for tackling larger projects.

  
  
**Benefits of the Two-Minute Rule**

  
**Reduces Procrastination**  
Procrastination often takes root when tasks appear overwhelming. The two-minute rule simplifies decision-making by setting a clear threshold for action. By encouraging the immediate completion of quick tasks, it helps maintain momentum and creates a proactive work ethic.  
  
**Efficient Task Management**  
This rule streamlines task management by clearing minor tasks quickly, allowing for better focus on more significant, time-consuming tasks. It acts as a natural filter, separating trivial tasks from those requiring more in-depth attention and planning.  
  
**Keeps Workflow Moving Smoothly**  
A cluttered workspace, both physically and digitally, can impede productivity. Applying the two-minute rule regularly helps in maintaining order and continuity in your workflow, as small tasks are dealt with promptly, leaving no room for unnecessary clutter.

  
  
**Implementing the Two-Minute Rule**  


**Identify Quick Wins**  
Begin by identifying tasks that fit the two-minute criterion. These can range from sending a quick email response to filing a document or making a brief phone call. The key is recognizing these opportunities and acting on them immediately.  
  
**Make It a Habit**  
Incorporate the two-minute rule into your daily routine until it becomes second nature. Over time, you‚Äôll find that your ability to assess and address tasks efficiently improves, significantly enhancing your overall productivity.  
  
**Evaluate and Adjust**  
Not all tasks estimated to take two minutes will do so. Periodically evaluate the effectiveness of your implementation of the two-minute rule. Adjust your approach as necessary, learning to better identify tasks that genuinely fit the criteria.  
  
**Leveraging Technology for Enhanced Productivity**  
While the two-minute rule is powerful on its own, combining it with productivity tools can further enhance its effectiveness. GANTTPRO is an excellent example of a project management tool that complements the two-minute rule, especially for larger projects that require detailed planning and task management. GANTTPRO allows you to break down projects into manageable tasks, some of which can be quickly completed in line with the two-minute rule, while others can be scheduled for focused work sessions.

**Conclusion**  
The two-minute rule is a testament to the power of simplicity in productivity. Encouraging immediate action on small tasks helps keep your workflow smooth, reduces procrastination, and promotes a more organized and productive work environment. When combined with project management tools like GANTTPRO, the two-minute rule can be an integral part of a comprehensive strategy for achieving peak productivity. Embrace the two-minute rule and transform those fleeting moments into stepping stones toward your productivity goals.",4,0,2024-04-20 10:18:36,email cluttered,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1c8jxha/the_power_of_the_twominute_rule_in_productivity/
r/productivity,How/when do I do the things that are never the most important?,"I have a really hard time doing the things that are never (or rarely) the most important thing I need to do.  For example:

* watering the plants
* going through the boxes of random stuff in my closet
* calling/emailing the friend that I've been meaning to get in touch with
* minor home improvement stuff
* cleaning out my (personal) email inbox
* etc.

None of those will ever be more important than:

* work
* doing the dishes
* making sure the kids are fed/bathed/in bed

Yet if I never water the plants (in practice I have an alert on my phone that I literally snooze for weeks before doing it) they'll all die, and I'll say ""why didn't I just take a 10 minute break from work to water them?""  The email inbox and clutter in the closet constantly bother me, but I can never justify spending time on those over more pressing things.  The home improvement stuff is kind of like the plants - if I ignore it for too long, it could get really bad.

So what strategies are there to handle these ""somewhat important but never urgent"" things?  In practice what happens is I wake up and think ""today is the day I'm going to take care of X, Y, and Z"" and then later in the day I'm bogged down with work and have to make dinner, and then think ""well, I can't justify spending time on X, Y, and Z over the other stuff.""

# Note Tools I Use and What I Need

\----------------------------------------

**SimpleNote**

For: Writing everything (emails, voiceover scripts, meeting notes, outlines, organized ideas)

Why: 100% cross-platform, plain text, quick to load, quick to write into, non-distracting UX

&amp;#x200B;

 \----------------------------------------

**Google Keep**

For: Quick freeform notes, things I need to quickly reference (e.g. friends' WiFi details, gym access code), quick to do lists

Why: Google ecosystem makes it easiest to access on Android phone, plain text, easy chunking of information, more notes in one view than folder- or note list-based UIs

&amp;#x200B;

 \----------------------------------------

**Evernote**

For: Long-term storage of original content, knowledge repository of saved articles

Why: I'm not entirely sure why use Evernote still. I'm an Evernote Certified Consultant. Cross-platform, quick Rich Text writing

&amp;#x200B;

 \----------------------------------------

**Microsoft To Do**

For: Daily To Do list

Why: Fast, uncomplicated, doesn't inspire me to get too deep into project and task planning like Todoist did

&amp;#x200B;

 \----------------------------------------

**\[Shared Documents in Google Docs, OneDrive, etc.\]**

For: Collaboration

Why: Outside entities (clients, vendors, friends) create a document and use it for collaborative note-taking or content development.

&amp;#x200B;

 ========================================

# Needs Lacking in Current Tools

&amp;#x200B;

* An automatic way to reveal connections between notes and pieces of information (ala Roam)
* A way to search all pieces of knowledge without having to search multiple apps/services individually
* Detailed project planning
* Project progress status and tracking

&amp;#x200B;

========================================

# Essential Needs for Tools

&amp;#x200B;

* Cross-platform (Mac, Android, iOS at minimum)
* Instant sync across devices
* Automatic saves as I type
* Fast loading (I need to get my ideas down quickly, often while in a meeting or listening/watching audio/video)
* Fast from load to writing (not a bunch of things to click/tap before I start typing)
* Easy, quick to start another note/task
* Relatively simple UI. For instance: too many toolbar buttons, toolbar buttons that use non-standard icons, or a Markdown preview pane always in view are distracting clutter
* Native apps (I don't like doing EVERYTHING inside Chrome)
* Searchable
* Low-cost (relatively speaking, the more a tool does, the more it replaces other tools, the more I'm willing to pay)
* Backups or ways to recover accidentally deleted posts",49,20,2021-01-05 21:23:01,email cluttered,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/kr5kan/brain_dump_notetaking_apps_and_needs/

r/productivity,"Streamlining My Business with Trello, Slack, Evernote, and Mailchimp","Hey guys, I wanted to share my experience as an entrepreneur and how platform tools like Trello, Slack, Evernote, and Mailchimp have made a huge impact on my business and productivity.

When I first started my business, I was doing everything on my own. I was keeping track of tasks on sticky notes, trying to communicate with my team through a cluttered inbox, and feeling like I was constantly playing catch up. But then, I discovered these tools.

Trello helped me organize all my tasks and projects in one place and see everything at a glance. Slack made it easy for me to communicate with my team and stay on the same page. Evernote became my go-to for storing all my notes and ideas in one place. And Mailchimp? It took my email marketing to the next level. I was able to create stunning newsletters, automate campaigns, and track my results.

Well, thanks to these platform tools, I've been able to streamline my business, work more efficiently, and focus on what's most important. If you're an entrepreneur like me, I can't recommend these tools enough. They'll help you stay organized, communicate effectively, and grow your business. I hope this helps you!",8,3,2023-02-04 00:59:10,email cluttered,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/10sy2mg/streamlining_my_business_with_trello_slack/
r/productivity,7 Apps I use to be more productive.,"### Heyüëã

I‚Äôve been using apps to boost my productivity for a while. For the past 3 years to be exact. This is the reason I‚Äôve decided to share the ones that have broken into my daily routine and that will probably help you too. I know there are millions of apps that are supposed to increase your productivity and to be honest, I‚Äôve tried a lot of them. After filtering if this app is useful enough, I have come to the 7 apps I cannot live without. I hope this saves you some time from researching everything!

### 7. [Slack](https://slack.com)

It‚Äôs not what you think! It‚Äôs actually not. I don‚Äôt use Slack to communicate with anyone. I am in some groups but that‚Äôs not the point. The point is that I use Slack to take quick notes. How? I make up new channels for each one of my projects and whenever I want to remember something related to a project I send it as a message. You‚Äôre probably wondering, why don‚Äôt you use some kind of fancy note-taking app, like Roam or Drafts. That‚Äôs because I find most note-taking apps cluttered, and not to the point, and others very simple for my liking.

### 6. [Forest](https://forestapp.cc)

This one is pretty obvious. I think. Pomodoro is one of the few scientifically proven methods to be more productive. For those not familiar with Forest, it is basically a fancy timer. You can set a work timer and a break timer. I usually do 40 minutes of work with 5 minutes of break. This can help you feel like you have something to anticipate. You can say to yourself ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just 24 more minutes of work. That‚Äôs not that much‚Äù and continue to be productive.

### 5. [Newsify](https://newsify.co)

Next on the list is Newsify. You may not know what Newsify is, so let me explain. Newsify is an RSS reader, it basically gathers all the articles and blog posts from people you follow and displays them to you. This helps me keep up with the blogs that I want to follow, without having to look up every single one. I used to use Feedly, but I prefer the interface of Newsify 100x times more.

### 4. [Mist](https://usemist.com)

In short, Mist is a Chrome Extension that helps you practice mindfulness without fully detaching from your work. Every few hours, I will do a simple Body Scan Meditation, because I have found that I am more productive that way. I prefer Mist rather than all the other mindfulness apps, because it is build into Google Chrome. I got access to it a couple weeks ago, because they currently have a waitlist, but it's a tool that I use everyday.

### 3. [Asana](https://asana.com)

Asana is my one-stop project manager. I use it to do everything from tracking progress on projects to writing down deadlines. I discovered this software about 3 months ago and it has really changed y workflow. You can organize your projects in a calendar or tasks view, but I personally use the calendar for almost everything. It is very easy to plan out what you have to do on a day-to-day basis for every project.

### 2. [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com)

Superhuman is one of those apps where you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that useful at first, but you can‚Äôt live without it. Simply, it is a fancy email app. They claim to help you get through your emails in 2x the time, and I find that to be true. They also helped me declutter and organize my inbox which is a big thing if you take into account my 21.000 unread emails. Yes. 21.000. After all that, I am proud to announce that I‚Äôve hit the fabled Inbox Zero.

### 1. [Notion](https://notion.so)

Have you ever googled anything related to productivity? Then you have probably come across Notion. Notion is an amazing note-taking app in which you can organize‚Ä¶ your whole life. I use Notion to keep track of my Reading List. I write down every book I get recommended and when I have time, I listen to them on Audible. I also have my goals and weird trips I want to do in there. If I listed everything, this article would be a book, so let‚Äôs move on. You can use the app in every way you like, as it‚Äôs super customizable.

Thanks for your time!",20,15,2021-05-03 22:35:46,email cluttered,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/n4560y/7_apps_i_use_to_be_more_productive/
r/productivity,Looking for a reminders app,"Good morning all,

I use Todoist as my major task list manager, but don‚Äôt want to clutter it with my many (many!) periodic reminders like ‚ÄúRemember to Exercise at 3pm‚Äù or ‚ÄúGo to shops at 1pm‚Äù etc. I‚Äôd prefer to keep Todoist such that if I look at the Upcoming filter, I see only project-related tasks.

I‚Äôm therefore looking for another task management app that meets the following criteria:

1. It works under Windows and iOS 

2. It can send task email reminders

3. It can handle unusual recurrences like ‚ÄúRepeat every 129 days at 3pm‚Äù

For the record, I‚Äôve tried creating a Google Calendar and FollowUpThen for this purpose, but editing tasks has not proven easy; and nor do I want to use Toodledo as their support has disappeared.

Many thanks

r/productivity,A super comprehensive guide on how to work from home,"Stumbled across this guide ([https://toggl.com/work-from-home](https://toggl.com/work-from-home/#productivity)) There's some good stuff in there - specifically found the section about personal productivity helpful. Copying some of the tips here:  


### If you‚Äôre sluggish in the morning

If you‚Äôd rather eat bugs than wake up before 8 AM, we feel you. But if your job requires you to be up and at 'em in the AM, you can trick yourself into being a bit more of a morning person. Try these tips:

* Allow yourself one ‚Äúsnooze‚Äù alarm before the real one.
* Eat breakfast at the same time every day, which can help your body settle into a pattern.
* Don‚Äôt sleep in on weekends‚Äìit will only make the weekdays more painful.
* Get some exercise first thing. It can reduce your blood pressure, lower anxiety, and wake you up.
* Eat protein-rich foods‚Äìlike eggs, milk, nuts, or yogurt‚Äìto boost your dopamine levels and give you energy.
* Don‚Äôt nap unless you really need to. It may signal to your brain that work hours = sleep hours, which will make separating them even more complicated.

#### If you have trouble staying organized

Working from home usually means you‚Äôre creating an office in a relatively compact space, if you have one at all. You may prefer to migrate from the couch to the counter to a chair throughout the course of the day. Wherever you‚Äôre working from, try these steps to stay organized:

* Don‚Äôt just organize your space, organize your time. Carve out blocks of time for everyday tasks‚Äìmaybe you catch up on Slack traffic for a half hour each morning or always clean out your inbox before signing off in the afternoon‚Äìso your day has a framework and your mind feels clear and focused.
* Even if you move around all day, keep a dedicated space for work items like papers, office supplies, and extra tech. Whether you have a solitary shelf, an entire desk, or a whole room (!), having a go-to spot for your work stuff will keep it from taking over your house.
* Tidy up your workstation(s) at the end of every day. No one wants to walk into their office to see mold growing on yesterday‚Äôs lunch dishes. Clear any coffee cups, dirty plates, loose papers, or trash. Wipe down your desk at the end of the day and put any clutter away (ideally in its dedicated work-stuff area).
* Keep an analog calendar nearby. Write down appointments, to-dos, and meetings to help you organize your day and keep your mind in work mode.
* Take cleaning breaks. Who said procrastinating couldn‚Äôt also be productive? When you need a break from staring at your computer, pick an area of your office or workstation to tidy up. Have a drawer that needs re-organizing? Put aside that email response for a few minutes and dig in.
* Invest in accessories. Maybe you‚Äôve got a green thumb. Or perhaps office supply stores are your favorite place to shop. Whether you‚Äôre into cork boards or calla lilies‚Äìor Post-Its or posters‚Äìdecorate your work area with things that make you feel comfortable and calm.

#### If you lose focus easily

When there‚Äôs no chance your boss will walk by, it‚Äôs significantly easier to give in to distractions. Being at home means there‚Äôs no separation between all the fun projects you want to do and all the not-as-fun tasks you need to accomplish. If you‚Äôre the type to get easily distracted, here are some ways to counteract that impulse:

* Stay off social media. If your personal willpower isn‚Äôt strong enough, get help from a blocker like [Self Control](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) or the Chrome extension [BlockSite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site-website-blocke/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh?hl=en).
* Take a gym break. Limiting your physical activity can make you feel more anxious and distracted. Use the gym as a break in the middle of the day, or get your mind into focus mode with an early-morning workout.
* Automate what you can. Whether you use a virtual assistant, email filters, or programs that pre-schedule posts and newsletters, take advantage of opportunities to automate tasks. That way, you won‚Äôt need to clutter your mind with tons of small, distracting details.
* Know when to clock out. Without physical barriers between work and life, you‚Äôll have to create artificial ones. Start by setting a time where you close your laptop and check out mentally. Otherwise, you‚Äôll feel distracted 24/7 and will [burn out](https://toggl.com/blog/recover-from-burnout).
* Create an end-of-day ritual. Maybe you wash your hands and face after you finish working or maybe you make some tea and read the news for 15 minutes. Perhaps you change out of work sweatpants into lounge sweatpants. Whatever it is, find a way to mark the end of your workday with an enjoyable ritual.

### If you work at home with kids

Remote work, under normal circumstances, can be ideal for parents. Cutting out a commute can leave you with more time for daycare runs, emergency doctor visits, and all of the other surprises that come with being a parent. But kids aren‚Äôt exactly known for being good at respecting boundaries or using indoor voices. So you may need to get strategic to make it all work. Try these tips:

* Talk to your kids. Tell them about your work and what you need in order to do it. Even if they‚Äôre young, they‚Äôll be more likely to follow rules (like knocking versus barging in if the door is closed) if they understand why those rules exist.
* Use a rewards system. If your kids respect your work boundaries or remain calm during an important call, thank them with something special that will give them an incentive to behave well in the future (hint: ice cream is a classic).
* Take shifts. If you‚Äôve got a partner, arrange a schedule where you each get one or several blocks of time to focus exclusively on work, ideally at the same time every day. By not splitting your attention, you‚Äôll be able to better focus on whatever task is at hand.
* Don‚Äôt expect 9-5 hours. Kids do not operate on business day schedules. Whether you‚Äôre splitting time with your partner or going it alone, embrace flexibility. Try working in designated time blocks throughout the day and track your time to make sure you‚Äôre not overworking.
* Save the cleaning for later. Step over those piles of dirty laundry, toys, and crayons. If you wait until your house is tidy to start working, guess what? You‚Äôre never going to start working. Engage your tunnel vision and ignore the mess.
* Use screen time as backup. Sometimes you need to jump on a conference call and really don‚Äôt want to be interrupted. Go ahead and employ a digital babysitter, aka television or video games. This works especially well if you limit screen time outside of your workday, but even if you don‚Äôt, don‚Äôt feel guilty about having Netflix pinch-hit for you.
* Get help. You can‚Äôt be a full-time parent with a full-time job and perform both simultaneously (at least, not well) without any help. If those are your expectations, you may need to readjust them. Asking for or arranging help isn‚Äôt always easy, but even a few hours a week of legitimate headspace can make a huge difference. After all, as a parent, you know how to be insanely productive in a limited amount of time!
* Be kind to yourself. Being a parent is hard. There will be days when you feel like you're failing as a parent or failing as an employee, or both. Don‚Äôt let the guilt get you down. You‚Äôre doing your best.",102,6,2020-06-22 22:00:28,email cluttered,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/hdygby/a_super_comprehensive_guide_on_how_to_work_from/
r/productivity,F*ck your productivity system. Seriously.,"Fuck your Notion templates that took longer to set up than actually doing the work.

Fuck your 27 different colored highlighters for ""time blocking"" - you're not mapping the genome, you're writing a grocery list.

Fuck your morning routine that starts at 4AM. The only thing you're optimizing is your caffeine addiction and sleep deprivation.

Fuck your pomodoro timer. If I wanted to live my life in 25-minute chunks, I'd go back to high school.

Fuck your inbox zero - emails multiply like rabbits anyway. Who are you trying to impress?

Fuck your 17 different productivity apps that all sync together in some ungodly digital centipede. You spend more time maintaining this shit than actually working.

Fuck ""deep work"" when you can't even focus long enough to finish reading this post without checking your phone.

Fuck your habit tracker that's giving you anxiety because you missed one day of meditation and now your perfect streak is ruined.

Here's what actually works: Do the fucking thing. That's it. Stop reading productivity on Medium. Stop watching YouTubers tell you how they organize their day in 15-minute intervals. Stop buying notebooks that cost more than your hourly rate.

You know what made our parents productive? They just sat down and did the work. They didn't need an app to tell them to drink water or take a break. They didn't have ""productivity workflows"" or ""second brains."" They had a pen, paper, and shit to do.

Want to be productive? Here's your system:

1. Write down what needs to get done
2. Do the hardest thing first
3. Everything else is bonus

That's it. That's the whole system. Not sexy enough? Doesn't cost $99/month? Tough shit.

Every time you add another layer to your ""productivity stack,"" you're just adding another excuse to procrastinate. Another thing to tweak. Another reason to not do the actual work.

You don't need a better system. You need to sit your ass down and work. Turn off notifications. Close the browser tabs. Put your phone in another room. And just fucking work.

And for the love of god, stop reading productivity subreddits (yes, including this one). The irony of procrastinating by reading about how to stop procrastinating isn't lost on me.

Now go do something useful instead of reading this. And if this post helped you procrastinate for 5 minutes, well... fuck you too. ‚ù§Ô∏è

The outcome is that you will have 3 basic sections. To do today, To do later and Waiting on replies. I've even been emailing myself a task in the subject line and using my inbox as a to-do list. This has made my inbox the 'center' of all work. 

I think the biggest benefit is that I am no longer forgetting tasks on my to-do list or finding them buried in my emails. It's all in one place that I can see exactly what I need to do (in the short-medium term). 

Each morning I roll through the inbox and star everything I'm doing that day.

r/productivity,Email organization &amp; compartmentalization‚Äî multiple email inboxes vs folders?,"I randomly ran into this question while reorganizing my email workflow.

  
When organizing or compartmentalizing your emails, do you prefer doing so using multiple email inboxes (addresses) or through folders (and sub-folders)?

  
When I worked in a large corporation quite some time ago, the team I was in managed emails through folders and sub-folders under the team's group email inbox.

  
Many years later, once I started owning personal custom domains with web hosting for my own business, I ditched the 'organize by folder' structure and instead created multiple email inboxes for different use-cases; e.g. myname@domain.com, shopping@domain.com, finances@domain.com, newsletters@domain.com, etc.

  
In retrospect, I think I made this change simply because I had the ability to create unlimited email inboxes with my own domain and wanted to take advantage of it. But now, I'm kind of revisiting the topic to determine which might be better.

  
Personally, when managing my emails in Thunderbird (which is the email client I use), I've found that organizing through multiple email inboxes provides clear visual separation between accounts and makes it a tad bit easier to see the overall picture of my emails, but the drawback is that I may need to duplicate message filters across inboxes because each rule can only apply to a single inbox (this duplication may slow down the client).

  
Now that I think about it, I can probably achieve the same level of organization using folders/sub-folders under a single inbox, without the drawback of having to create duplicate message filters across multiple inboxes (thereby speeding up the client and process).

  
So...which do you prefer for your email management, and why?",1,0,2024-09-13 10:56:53,email organization,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1ffpbmh/email_organization_compartmentalization_multiple/

r/productivity,Turns out I wasn't unproductive - I just sucked at being a functional human,"I used to think I was ""hustling"" but I was just a shell of a person staring at screens. Like most productivity-obsessed people, I tried everything:

* Every task management system you can name
* ""Optimized"" morning routines that just drained me
* Email organization systems I'd abandon within days
* Productivity extensions I'd inevitably disable
* Those aesthetic desk setup videos that just emptied my wallet

None of it worked because I was completely neglecting myself outside of work. My health was terrible, my social skills had disappeared, and I thought being glued to my laptop meant I was successful.

Then I started tracking my habits w a random ""real men"" productivity app (all of them, not just work), and the data showed me some hard truths about myself.

Reality check? I wasn't unproductive because:

1. I needed better productivity apps
2. My workspace wasn't optimized enough
3. I hadn't found the right morning routine

I was unproductive because:

1. My health was a mess from zero exercise and poor diet
2. I barely had real conversations anymore
3. I normalized feeling physically terrible
4. I thought self-care was a waste of time

Real change started when I stopped being so one-dimensional:

* Actually started working out consistently
* Fixed my terrible eating habits
* Learned how to connect with people again
* Got interests outside of work
* Made sleep a priority

6 months later:

* Accomplishing more in 6 focused hours than 12 scattered ones
* Actually have energy because I take care of myself
* Can think clearly because my body isn't falling apart
* People actually want to work with me now

The irony? Becoming a well-rounded person made me better at work than any productivity hack ever did.

r/productivity,I get way too many emails and get overwhelmed. How can I organize this in a better way than using Gmail filters?,"I get thousands of emails and it's just way too much to keep up with. Usually if someone absolutely needs me right away they will just Slack me, but I'm missing too many emails because I'm on basically every list ever. 
  
I don't want to *not* have the emails - even if it's just informational I want to have it archived somewhere in case I need to reference it again. So what I've usually done is just set up filters based on email domains or subject lines - but over time, these change formats and stuff I don't need starts creeping back into my main inbox and then I add another filter to deal with that and then the problem keeps growing.

There are several thousand people in my company and we work with several other companies each with their own thousands of people. It's very hard to create filters which archive the stuff I know I don't need right away vs communication from the same groups that I do need.

r/productivity,Seeking methods/practices for organizing my email without using conversation view (Outlook/Exchange),"I have a unique email conundrum that I'd like some help solving, and I hope this subreddit is the right place to ask. TLDR I have been accustomed to using my email with [conversation threading/conversation view](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/view-email-messages-by-conversation-0eeec76c-f59b-4834-98e6-05cfdfa9fb07) for nearly 20 years, but I am seeking advice (methods/practices) for how to stay organized in Outlook ***without*** using conservation view due to a server-level bug.

***Context:***  
I'm a mid-level professional working at a university that uses Microsoft Exchange (Outlook). In 2020 the IT department introduced a number of new anti-phishing practices using a third-party vendor, including inserting ""External"" into the subject line of emails originating outside of the university.

Unfortunately, this subject line insertion breaks conversation threading when we receive external emails from anyone using Gmail/Google Workspace. This is because of the different ways that Exchange and Gmail handle subject lines and conversation metadata for the conversation view setting. Thus, even when using Outlook with ""show as conversations"" turned on, these external emails will NOT be grouped together in the conversation view if anyone involved on the thread replies from a Gmail-based email.

It took around 18 months of troubleshooting for the IT department to determine there is nothing they can do to fix the issue until the vendor updates the source of the problem (and it's been around another year since then with no solution). The best workaround we could find was to use another email client like Thunderbird, but that removes a number of the Outlook-specific features that are useful for collaboration with internal parties, and for other reasons is not always available (e.g., if I am checking email from a browser on another computer). Therefore, I would prefer to implement a methodological solution rather than a technical one.

I have struggled with organizing long threads with external parties since this change took place. While there are many productivity and work etiquette practices out there that can help make email threads with multiple people more manageable (e.g., concise messages, meeting instead of emailing), those practices don't help if the parties you're collaborating with don't know/use such practices or if email is the best way to collaborate (e.g., time zone differences). So I'm just trying to focus on what I can control on my end, which is the ability to read the conversation in chronological order and reply in a timely manner. On days where there are multiple threads impacted by this issue, I end up creating new folders to drag the emails into (one folder per conversation) so that I can read them in order and ensure I'm not missing something. It's tedious and time-consuming, and I desperately need a better method.

***My Ask:***  
A recent change in my job duties means I will be emailing even more frequently with external parties, and therefore encountering this problem more often. Therefore, **I am seeking advice about how to organize and keep track of a large volume of email conversations** **WITHOUT** **using conversation threading** (""show as conversations"" in Outlook). I'm specifically interested in **organizational methods or strategies** so that I am not reliant on a specific app or feature.

Some factors that may impact what method would work well for me are: 1) I use this email address for multiple roles I hold (e.g., staff role, adjunct role, external committees and boards), and 2) I am often working with different types of stakeholders/clients, including some who may also hold multiple roles in our interactions (e.g., a colleague who is also on an external board with me, a student who is also collaborating on a project with us). I am also aware that my email organization strategy may depend on higher level productivity practices, like better organizing/categorizing my projects and areas of responsibility, and I am open to suggestions in that direction as well.

I know this is a dense post, so I really appreciate the time anyone takes to read through it. It's been a frustrating issue that I am desperate to address, and I look forward to seeing advice and suggestions that may help. **Thank you in advance for any ideas and advice!!**",2,2,2023-02-22 05:13:36,email organization,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/118nee3/seeking_methodspractices_for_organizing_my_email/

\- There's tons of emails, that don't really fit into any of the main categories, and I don't want to create 40 different categories either. How to categorize those that are valuable for a specific purpose, but not enough to warrant their own category?

Right now, the Emails are just a huge time-sink, so it would be great to get a proper system in place.

r/productivity,Small changes that fixed my productivity after burning out twice,"Burned out HARD twice in the last few years from trying to do too much. Finally got my productivity to a sustainable level with some counterintuitive changes.

The stuff that's actually helping (might sound obvious but took me forever to implement):

* no meetings before 11am protected morning time for deep work changed everything. my brain works better in the morning and I was wasting it on calls.
* deleted slack from my phone. Was very nervous at first, but after pushing through.... nothing bad happened lol
* started using this ""act now"" rule for small tasks - if it takes &lt;5 mins, do it immediately instead of adding to my list. Reduced my mental load like crazy.
* used this app inbox zapper to clean up my mess of an inbox. previously was too scared to even try, but after about 30min I deleted literally thousands of emails and got things under control.
* stopped using multiple to-do apps and went back to a simple paper notebook. the apps were making me spend more time organizing tasks than doing them. I did get a fancy japanese one on amazon to make it feel more 'advanced'.
* ""done for the day"" ritual at 6pm where I write down the first 3 tasks for tomorrow, then close my laptop. helps my brain disconnect and flush things out at the end of the day.
* started viewing rest as productive. sounds cheesy but realizing that recovery isn't ""being lazy"" was huge for me - still working on this though, transparently.
* started making sure I get 10k steps a day. Apple watch makes it super easy to track, and I find even just hitting that goal makes me feel productive and also has added health benefit. too easy to get stuck staring at a computer in a chair all day otherwise.

The irony is I'm actually getting MORE done while working fewer hours. Wish someone had forced me to make these changes years ago.

r/productivity,Looking for email organization app suggestion,"Hi everyone -- 

I run a small organization and we have seven people that run most of the behind-the-scene planning. We all share one inbox and have been having the following consistent issues:  
\- emails have been getting buried under unimportant emails   
\- team members have been opening emails and forgetting to mark them as ""unread"" whenever the email is targeted towards a different person  
\- team member seeing an email that pertains to them, marking it as unread, and then forgetting to respond as the email is buried before they have a chance to respond  
\- we get consistent emails that frequently arent needed to be read but we would like to know when we have a new one (example: we all run a small cafe and get produce supplier lists every week -- while we dont necessarily need to read produce supplier lists every week, but like to know when we have new ones to check if we want to order anything new)

&amp;#x200B;

Our current system (in gmail) is:  
\- mark all emails as unread if you read them and they arent directed to a case you are working on  
\- star emails you are working on and intend to return to later (in a way ""claiming"" it)

The issues with this current system is the inbox customization gmail offers on desktop doesnt seem to work over the app, where over half our team solely accesses the inbox -- so unread emails dont stick to the top of the page. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our fun twist is that everyone works a similar role and takes on cases as they have the ability to do so, so I don't necessarily want to ""assign"" anyone specific to a role -- I'm looking for an email manager that would allow us to  
\- have people ""claim"" emails to respond to  
\- have the app send someone a notification every 2 days that the email is not responded to (some of our emails take a while to respond to due to their detailed nature, and someones are forgotten about)  
\- have non-important emails moved to a different folder but be able to see notifications for these folders  


\*If theres a system that can solve our problems with a different system than that above, I'm very open to it.  


I've spent maybe 12 hours total looking at different email managers for shared inboxes and I haven't found anything that has stuck yet. We don't need a ton of fancy features, just something to help make sure emails are taken care of!  


I know this is a tall order, but are there any apps that seem like they would be able to meet our needs?",2,2,2021-03-03 00:12:53,email organization,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/lwdyt3/looking_for_email_organization_app_suggestion/

The biggest problem I had was that my boss kept creating new mail threads for a single task/topic.

But it became literally impossible for me to categorize these different email threads about the same topic into a particular category. I tried using labels, but they quickly got out of hand because
a) I realized I had created too many labels. At one point I had labels like Client1Task1 and Client1Task2 and so on.
b)Everytime an email came in, I had to manually categorize it, and if I forgot to label a particular mail, it would mostly be lost in my inbox flood.

We have 12 team members across the country, in 3 different departments (sales, support and marketing).

We don't have general sales@ or support@ email addresses yet but I think that's where we need to go. 

My concern is who gets the replies to these emails and how to best delegate those emails within each department. 

I've looked at Zendesk but it implies that we would need to keep that app open the whole time to respond to those emails, and our sales team would 100% still be using their own personal email addresses to handle their accounts.

    Use whatever system makes you feel empowered
    Do the work in whatever way works for YOU
    Everything else is nobody else's business

That's it. That's the whole truth. Not cynical enough? Doesn't make you feel bad about your choices? Sorry not sorry!

Every time you find a tool that genuinely helps you, embrace it. If your ""productivity stack"" actually helps you get things done, stack it higher than a Jenga tower.

You don't need a simpler system if your complex one works. You don't need a fancier system if your basic one works. You just need what works for YOU. Turn off the judgment. Close the criticism tabs. Put the productivity-shamers in another room. And just do your thing.

And for the love of god, keep reading about productivity if that helps you (yes, even on this subreddit). The joy of finding your perfect system isn't lost on me.

Now go do something in whatever way works best for you. And if this post helped you feel better about your choices for 5 minutes, well... you're welcome! üòâ",350,32,2025-01-07 15:52:33,email organization,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1hvrvk9/love_your_productivity_system_seriously/

I'm trying to organize Gmail with filters and I know it's a very common topic, but when I googled how to actually create filters for Gmail I found out that it is extremely inconvenient to do so. 

Basically, you have to create a filter by search query, but this is actually not very easy because

1. The mails you received will NOT show on the search result. Only the addresses you sent a mail before will show up. You basically have to memorize the whole email. 
2. You can't easily append to an existing filter. Say you read an email and created a filter right away. You move on to the next email and if you want to add that sender to the same filter, you would have to go to the filter edit page and manually add the sender.

I wasn't satisfied with Outlook's organizing experience but compared to this, Outlook feels like a future technology.

* How do you track document types, expiration dates, or even just where stuff is stored?
* Do you have any naming convention for documents/dates?

I'm basically trying to be more productive in random everyday things and I found out that this is one of the things that just slows me down instead of my time being more productive towards things that need to be done.

r/productivity,5 Simple Automation Workflows That Save 10+ Hours Per Week,"After helping dozens of small businesses streamline their operations, I've noticed the same time-wasting tasks everywhere. Here are 5 automations that consistently save the most time - no coding required.

## 1. **Auto-Sort Incoming Emails (Saves ~3 hours/week)**

**The Problem:** Spending 20-30 minutes daily organizing emails, missing important messages in the chaos.

**Simple Solution:** Use Gmail filters or Outlook rules to automatically:
- Send invoices to a ""Billing"" folder
- Route support emails to a ""Customer Support"" label  
- Flag emails from VIP clients
- Auto-forward certain types to team members

**Setup time:** 15 minutes **Weekly savings:** 3+ hours

## 2. **Customer Inquiry Auto-Response System (Saves ~4 hours/week)**

**The Problem:** Answering the same questions repeatedly, delayed response times hurting customer satisfaction.

**Simple Solution:** Set up canned responses that:
- Acknowledge receipt instantly
- Answer common FAQs automatically
- Route complex queries to the right person
- Include relevant links/resources

**Tools:** Gmail templates, Outlook Quick Parts, or any CRM with auto-responders
**Setup time:** 30 minutes **Weekly savings:** 4+ hours

## 3. **Automated Invoice Follow-ups (Saves ~2 hours/week)**

**The Problem:** Manually tracking unpaid invoices, awkward follow-up conversations.

**Simple Solution:** Automated email sequences that:
- Send friendly reminders 3 days before due date
- Follow up 7 days after due date
- Escalate to a stronger tone after 14 days
- CC your accounting team when needed

**Setup time:** 45 minutes **Weekly savings:** 2+ hours

## 4. **Social Media Cross-Posting (Saves ~2 hours/week)**

**The Problem:** Manually posting the same content across multiple platforms.

**Simple Solution:** Use tools like Buffer, Hootsuite, or Zapier to:
- Post to all platforms simultaneously
- Customize content for each platform automatically
- Schedule posts in batches
- Auto-share blog posts when published

**Setup time:** 20 minutes **Weekly savings:** 2+ hours

## 5. **Lead Data Auto-Collection (Saves ~3 hours/week)**

**The Problem:** Manually entering contact form submissions into spreadsheets or CRMs.

**Simple Solution:** Connect your forms directly to your database:
- Contact forms ‚Üí Google Sheets/CRM
- Meeting bookings ‚Üí Calendar + CRM
- Newsletter signups ‚Üí Email platform + CRM
- Include automatic lead scoring

**Setup time:** 30 minutes **Weekly savings:** 3+ hours

---

## **Getting Started:**

**Week 1:** Pick ONE automation that addresses your biggest pain point
**Week 2:** Test and refine it
**Week 3:** Add the second automation
**Week 4:** Continue building your stack

The key is starting small. Don't try to automate everything at once - focus on the tasks that genuinely waste your time daily.

## **Tools I Recommend:**
- **Free:** Gmail filters, Outlook rules, IFTTT
- **Budget-friendly:** Zapier starter plan, Buffer free tier
- **Growing business:** Monday.com, HubSpot, ActiveCampaign

**What's your biggest time-waster that you think could be automated?** Drop it in the comments and I'll suggest a simple solution.

In terms of what I use for instruction/assessment/LMS is as follows:

\-Google Workplace for Education- for all documents/slidedecks/sheets/etc

\-Google Classroom and Canva- LMS-Gmail

\-Icloud and Google Drive for Storage

I'm merely trying to find something a bit more easy to use and similar to Apple Classroom but with an ability to use storage outside of icloud explicitly b/c the school I work at uses google drive exclusively despite providing macbooks to teachers. I know it makes little sense as there's such a degree of disoragnization from above that it makes things somewhat difficult. 

Or might I be better off to create an app of my own using playlabai or something similar?

Not necessarily the same app, but recently began coordinating various projects and receive a large number of emails and have a large amount of data to maintain. 

My organization primarily uses Google docs and Gmail (not unusual in our industry). In previous similar roles, the org used an outlook version with a flag system that helped me stay on top of emails and issues. I'm not sure that is possible where I am now so need alternatives. Currently learning Smartsheets for some tasks but it isn't all I need. I looked at MS Access but I'm not a data analyst so need something more user friendly that I can use immediately.

r/productivity,Gmail/IOS mail sanitize (remove all mail),"So I‚Äôm a board of directors member for a youth sports organization that I‚Äôm about to quit from because of threats of physical violence and harassing behaviour from another board members family. 

I have a gmail account that was originally set up by the chair of the organization. That person has been excluded from nearly half of all board communications due to it being ‚Äúin camera‚Äù discussion about issues that they were declared to have a conflict of interest in. 

When I originally added the gmail account to IOS mail, I never changed the password, or the recovery details. So if they were to recover the password, they would then be able to read through all of the messages that were sent pertaining to issues they declared a conflict for. 

I have backed up all of the emails to a folder on another gmail account and have gone through all of the folders on that board account and trashed all emails (sent folder I had to move to another folder before trashing them). 

I then emptied the trash can. 

On IOS mail, I can no longer see ANY emails sent to or from that account in ANY folders. Can I rest assured that when they recover this account that it will be a clean slate?

r/productivity,How do you guys organize your e-mail life? Any AI help? I end up failing and need some input,"Hey guys, 

the title says it: every now and then, I make a new Gmail adress, promising myself, that I will just use it for non-shopping stuff. I disable notifications for my old address, which is registered at all my online shops and stuff like that, to not be spammed and get notifications everywhere from 80% unimportant emails. 

After some time, I recognize ""Oh, this order is important I want to get notifications. Amazon is important. Oh this and that and I change a lot of stuff, where I am registered to my new e-mail and after some time, I have the same chaos and spam all day. 

Of course, I could just skip all the online shopping, services, newsletter etc. - but I am mainly registered, where I don¬¥t want to miss sometimes promotion. Everything else I just unsub/unregister. In the end, I still keep missing some promotions/deal, because I collect all the newsletter for some days, have too much to read and just bulk delete them. So this doesn¬¥t work out. 

Also I have not thaaaaat many real important private emails, so sometimes I end up missing one, because of the mass of emails I get per day (mass is relative, I am sure a lot of people receive way more...but it is still too much in this unorganized way). 

So how do you guys organize your email life? 

  
Some details, so you might have some direct recommendations for me: 

1. Using Gmail, but never really understood, how to filter/label mails and organizing stuff in my Inbox. So everything is just coming into my inbox. 

2. Living in the Apple ecosystem. Tried different mail clients on top of Gmail. Still not sure, which app, I should use and is free (or very cheap - don¬¥t want to spend 10 EUR / month for a mail app). I think, I tried the majority of apps within the last years. Most of the time I stayed with Edison (also unorganized), but then it started, to  delays in sending/receiving, so ditched it. Now back to Apple Mail - especially because I had big hope for Apple Intelligence, which is not coming to Germany anyways now. Also Apple Mail on the iPhone has some delays with Gmail as far as I know. So its not perfect. 



What I would love to have (getting in mind while writing this: 

Set up advanced filters and subfolders and the possibility, to decide when I get notified by what. E.g. all non-newsletter, real mails -&gt; immediate notification and all in one place. This should also include real messages from support request/answers from online shops or services, but not newsletter. 

Then its getting tricky: ""important"" non-private mails like dispatch, ""you¬¥ve got a message"" on platform xy, tracking information like Amazon orders etc. - on the other hand...most Apps notify me anyways. Do I really need those mails? When Amazon delivered a package, I get notified twice, which is kinda useless. 

And finally we have two types of newsletter: one from shopping - I don¬¥t want to miss it, but don¬¥t need immediate notifications. An AI Assistant, which sends me from all those a summary once per day, would be awesome. But having them filtered out into a specific folder without notifications, would also be enough and then look through them once per day or two days and delete everything (or save informations like codes or something somewhere else for later use)

Second type are information newsletter for education, news to various topics etc. Also no immediate information, but should be in another folder and do the same, like the shopping stuff. 

Maybe I am overcomplicating stuff. But I fail to find a system for me for years. I get way too many notifications and miss stuff in the unorganized inbox - and it annoys me. 

  
I would be happy for any input. Changing apps or even email provider (I like Gmail for its reliability, but the organization, labeling, filtering, how its not perfectly working in time with Apple Mail, the layout in the webapp..I don¬¥t really like). 

  
Thank you very much!!!

r/productivity,Overwhelmed and Unorganized ," I'm feeling completely overwhelmed with how disorganized my life has become. I've been juggling multiple email accounts (Gmail, iCloud, Yahoo, Hotmail), switching between Android and iPhones, and have a ton of unread emails and messages. My cloud storage (iCloud and Google Drive) is a mess, and my notes and calendars are a complete disaster.

I've tried various planning apps but never seem to stick with them. This disorganization is affecting my work, personal life, finances, and overall productivity. I have so many good ideas and take notes, but I can't seem to follow through. My financial life is also a mess, and I can't keep track of my income and expenses.

I'm feeling really discouraged and need some advice. Where should I start? Does anyone have any tips for decluttering my life and getting organized?

r/productivity,Time to get your act together! I made an app to organize your life and decided to make it completely free until New Year!,"I worked on the iOS version of this app for 5 months but it's actually not doing well at all.. So I decided, fuck it, let's make it completely free until New Year. **It‚Äôs better to have more people enjoy it than me making a little bit of money from it :)**

&amp;nbsp;

**The app should be able to get you through the initial after-new-year-slump, when people decide to quit their resolutions.. which typically occurs after 2 weeks..**

&amp;nbsp;

If you want the free upgrade, you can just go to More &gt; Get Premium in the iOS app and tap the ""Get Premium"" button. If for whatever reason it doesn't work you can always send an email to habitbull@gmail.com and I‚Äôll upgrade you manually

&amp;nbsp;

**What can HabitBull do for you?**

&amp;nbsp;

It helps you organize your life and form routines. It's being used for: dieting, learning a new language, fitness, not drinking alcohol, stopping smoking, meditation, flossing and even nofap..

 &amp;nbsp;

**Why should you give it a try?**

 &amp;nbsp;

There are no ads at all. It has discussion forums, motivational images, a calendar for each habit separately, reminders, notes, cloud backup &amp; sync etc. I've personally used it to start flossing, going to the gym 2x per week and learning a new language, but obviously I'm biased!

&amp;nbsp;

Here‚Äôs a Youtube video about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQLstAq6d5g

&amp;nbsp;

And here‚Äôs the link for iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/habitbull-habit-tracker/id1041482672?ls=1&amp;mt=8

&amp;nbsp;

If you like the app and you want to help me out, the single most important thing you can do is click the above link and leave a review :)

&amp;nbsp;

r/productivity,"On July 1st, the second half of the year is ready for some tackling!","Are success stories allowed on here? I wanted to track my progress against some of my goals using advice I've picked up here. Partly a monthly diary/accountability through year-end for me.

One of the big boosts to my productivity this year was quitting alcohol last fall. Now, I keep my workout progress, my sleep is improved compared to last summer, which has its own benefits.¬† Surprisingly too, I‚Äôm not wilting in the summer heat. No weight loss, but stairs/hikes are easy, heat doesn't drain me, mornings are fun, HR and BP are better (and I can actually feel that), and I say yes to more social things. I'm 1000x more organized.I look a lot healthier. For anyone who has a Garmin, look at HR and sleep metrics when you drink vs. when you don't. It's wild.

This is not a self-help post, and I don't have any advice or pointers. I wanted to highlight the benefits this choice has provided me. Party college, party work, party friends,¬† but post-35 I just started yapping to anyone in my real life how I really feel like crap when I drink, and tried to gain any sympathetic ear I could. Turns out, others felt similarly and we all drink way less now. I could actively feel myself getting old, but it turns out, my body just doesn't like booze anymore!¬†

That one choice opened up a ton of productivity for me. I have more hours in a day since I'm not sleeping in, and more time for creative outlets I dropped due to work. Music, photography especially, writing, sports. Planning/sticking to things and focusing is easier - I have time to learn and study now .. I could add more.

I think mostly my mind just slowed down - listening to the right things is easier? 

This subreddit¬† gave me a green light basically to try some things out, like dropping drinking/partying, and it went way better than expected so I wanted to share. Again, not a self-help post.

r/productivity,Looking for a personal knowledge management system (perhaps Airtable?),"UPDATE: Just wanted to update my original post to say that I ended up giving [Capacities.io](https://Capacities.io) a try, and I feel like it's going to accomplish everything I wanted plus a lot more. It has some features that click really well with me. I'm going to try using it as my main note taking and second brain platform over the next couple of weeks to see how well it suits my needs. 

&amp;#x200B;

I work in IT and I'm always juggling a ton of personal development and research content. I have YouTube playlists, Pluralsight playlists, dedicated Gmail inboxes for longer newsletters and things I mail myself, an Inbox folder in Google Drive that I dump PDF's to read  later, RSS feeds, screenshots of technical diagrams that end up in Apple Photos albums, Arc bookmarks, etc.

Each of those systems in and of themselves are fairly well organized. The problem is, I have no unified view into ALL of my systems holistically. If I have an hour to spend and I want to consume some content, where do I allocate it? I can easily spend 10 minutes or more just surfing between different systems to decide what I want to watch or read.

What I think I want/need is a system that can accept various forms of unstructured content and basically act as an index that sits on top of everything. When I find a YouTube video I'd like to watch, I send it to the system. See a website I want to read, send it to the system. Take a screenshot I want to save / research later, send it to the system. You get the point.  I envision the system having a central inbox which I would review daily, and be able to tag each item / record as appropriate. I'd like a graphical Kanban-like view so I can put my items / records into various buckets and get a big-picture view of everything. I'd like each record to have some customizable metadata such as tags, like I said, perhaps a duration field so I can note how much time I expect needing to devote to each record (is it an hour-long YouTube video or a PDF I can read in 10 minutes), obviously a URL field that links back to the source content, etc. It would be nice if the record can store attachments, like PDF's, but if its URL field can link back to the doc on my Google Drive, that's fine too.

After I've consumed the content, I'd like to be able to move the record to a knowledge base section of the system (assuming I've found the content valuable, otherwise I may just want to delete the record).

And finally, it needs to be easy to get content into the system. When I find something I want to save, be it an email, document, image, YouTube video, etc., it would be great if I can just tap an option in the share sheet to send it to the system. All of my devices are Apple: iPhone, iPad, and MacBook Pro so that should hopefully make things easier. I'm fine creating a custom Apple Shortcut or IFTTT rule if need be.

All of that having been said, does anyone have any recommendations for a tool or platform that can accomplish this? I haven't tried Airtable yet but it looks like it could work and I plan on testing it over the weekend. I also want to note that I've used Notion in the past and I don't like it and don't see it as a viable option even if it checks all the boxes.",2,9,2023-10-27 17:45:43,gmail organization,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/17hp69n/looking_for_a_personal_knowledge_management/
r/productivity,Apps That Actually Make You Productive and Aren‚Äôt Crap,"Noobs search for tools. Pros search for systems.  
I am a firm believer in this statement. Before I started writing, I used to waste a lot of time searching for the perfect tools, software, and caffeine I needed.  
All this sounds like a lot of work.  
I did nothing.  
Had I spent all that time writing instead of ‚Äòproductively‚Äô procrastinating, I would probably have been a top writer by now.  
So why am I writing this?  
1. The right tools can help a person in their work.  
2. We aren‚Äôt living in the 20th century.  
These apps are the ones I genuinely use, and none of them have sponsored me, nor do I receive any affiliate commissions (keeping it real guys).  
  
Obsidian  
  
This is my headquarters.  
Everything happens here. The article you are reading was written here. All my notes, journals, and everything in between go here.  
No Obsidian, no life (and no, I don‚Äôt have romantic feelings for the app).  
Here‚Äôs what I like about it:  
1. Completely offline and mark-down: Obsidian is always offline and works in mark-down format, so if I ever get tired of it, I am not locked in an ecosystem, unlike many apps (I am looking at you, Notion).  
2. Privacy first: Since Obsidian is completely offline, there is no real way in which my privacy could be compromised. This was one of my main issues with Notion since it isn‚Äôt end-to-end encrypted.  
3. Completely intuitive: I follow Tiago Forte‚Äôs Second Brain System, and I know that many people find Obsidian has a learning curve, but that was never the case for me. I found it easiest to use.  
  
So, how do I start?  
  
Download the app  
Set up your Obsidian vault.  
Create folders (I use Archive, Areas, Projects, and Resources as my main folder with many sub-folders).  
Start note-taking.  
Watch a YouTube (I personally really liked this one)  
While I don‚Äôt think Obsidian is for everyone, it is one heck of an app.  
  
  
Clockify  
  
I didn‚Äôt realize how much time I used to waste thinking I was ‚Äòworking‚Äô.  
Clockify is a free app that automatically tracks your time across the various apps you use on your device and presents them in a nice format.  
While it does not have the functionality of rize.io, it works pretty well for being free.  
  
Pinterest  
  
  
Like Obsidian, Pinterest is also my note-taking app.  
For images. I could use the canvas feature in Obsidian for this. But images deserve a separate form of media to be consumed.  
I also use Pinterest for inspiration when I am designing something in Canva.  
  
Opera GX  
  
Opera GX is the browser of my choice because:  
  
It runs faster on my device.  
Aesthetic  
More features than Chrome  
Free VPN and Ad-blocker  
Regular updates  
Pretty cool community  
Highly customizable  
Opera GX strikes just the right balance between fun and productivity before it starts feeling like a gimmick or productivity-centered corporate machine.  
Opera is anything you want it to be.  
It can feel like an anime-centered weeb and also run a Barbie theme in the background.  
  
Kindle  
  
I haven‚Äôt bought a single physical book since 2019. Kindle is just way too good  
While I use the device, Kindle can work like an app on a device.  
In a fast-paced world where everything is consumed in 60 seconds while having a video slime cut at the bottom, reading is highly important.  
So why use the Kindle over physical books?  
  
Faster access to books  
Cheaper books  
More comfortable  
Easier note-taking  
More portable (can carry a thousand books while being lighter than one)  
Kindle is one of the best purchases of my life.  
  
Pocket and Instapaper  
  
  
Have you ever saved something to your watch later on YouTube, and when you looked back at it, you realized how stupid it was and how much time you were wasting on it?  
Pocket and Instapaper are watch-later (or rather read-later) for blogs and articles online.  
So why two apps?  
One for life-related stuff.  
Other for work.  
  
Notion  
  
If you have ever watched a single productivity video or article, you have probably heard of Notion.  
I have a love-hate relationship with Notion. Because others found the love of their lives, I felt overwhelmed and confused.  
I bought Thomas Frank‚Äôs $100 Notion template, and yet, I still felt overwhelmed.  
I was spending more time playing with Notion than actually taking notes. And I believe in functionality before aesthetics and features  
But that doesn‚Äôt make Notion useless.  
I still use Notion for my research and as a database. I still use it to organize my life and reflect.  
It just doesn‚Äôt fit me as much as Obsidian.  
  
Here are some other apps that boost my productivity that I didn‚Äôt mention because they seem pretty self-explanatory:  
  
YouTube (for saving videos and learning new stuff)  
WhatsApp and Discord (since social well-being is part of being more productive)  
Google Cloud  
Grammarly and Quill Bot  
Pycharm and Python (currently learning the language)  
Duolingo (for learning French)  
Gmail  
Share X (screenshot app with way more functionality than the in-built Windows tool)  
Chat-GPT and Google Bard (I don‚Äôt copy-paste, I promise.)  
Proton-VPN  
That‚Äôs it.  
You probably know you almost need all of these apps and don‚Äôt need the ones you don‚Äôt.  
But how do I choose which app to use?  
I don‚Äôt think copying other people's systems is the way to go.  
What you need to do is write down everything you do in a day, and then write down the stuff that could be better.  
You are only going to stick to an app when you need it, not when you want it.  
And remember, productivity is more than having the right tools.  
  
Just do it.

r/productivity,Tips for cutting down on needless email volume?,"Does anyone have any pointers for dealing with a high volume of emails, most of which are annoying/useless?

I‚Äôve been getting my organization around important items much more in shape, but my email inbox has been one area where I‚Äôm on shakier ground.

I‚Äôve personally decided I want to do an inbox zero approach because it really jives with my work volume and overall approach.

But one hurdle of either inbox zero or really any approach is I have a ton of crap mail I get every day.  Mixed in with juuuust enough relevant mail that makes a simple rules-based approach problematic.  Every once in a while there‚Äôs something somewhat important in that promotions tab in my Gmail.  That sort of thing.

The best would be if it has some integrations with the browser and gmail, but it is not necessary.

I would love if it would have some kind of ""Spaces"" or ""Workspaces"" to separate my work and life stuff.

r/productivity,"Having a zillion browser tabs open is a distraction, so here are my 3 strategies for handling this","If you're like me, you have dozens of browser tabs open. Tabs with interesting articles, random Google searches, and documents related to your work.

But having eleventy-billion tabs open is a massive distraction. (And it bogs down our computer.)

So here are my three strategies for keeping open tabs to a minimum:

1. When the tab has an interesting article, I bookmark it in my ""Read Later"" bookmarks folder and close the tab.   
(Do I ever go back and look at these bookmarks? Almost never. But just knowing they're bookmarked quiets my monkey brain.)
2. When the tab has a document for work, I bookmark it in my ""Work"" folder and close the tab.   
Also, these bookmarks begin with a date.   
Example: ""2023-06-21 - Project Rosebud, Q3 Planning, Revision 3.1""   
I have 100+ bookmarks for work, sorted by date, so they're easy to find.
3. When the tab has a random Google search, like `robert frost quotes`, I put the search term in my ""Idea Inbox,"" and I close the tab. My ""Idea Inbox"" is just a notes file that syncs between my computer and phone.

It's worth mentioning that I keep a few tabs pinned (and permanently open), like my work calendar, personal calendar, and Grammarly. I use these multiple times a day, so there's no point in closing them.

Now, part of my morning routine includes closing yesterday's tabs. But sometimes mornings get busy, and I don't do this, so I have 15 minutes scheduled every Saturday morning to clear out my tabs. (At this time, I also clear out my Downloads folder and my Desktop folder, which is usually cluttered with screenshots. Digital hygiene for the win!)

So there you have it. That's how I manage to close unnecessary tabs and stay focused.

But that's me.

r/productivity,How can I avoid using too many apps?,"Hey everyone! 

Unfortunately, I suffer from a major case of shiny new toy syndrome. I have seemingly tried every task manager, every note app, every mind-mapping tool etc. under the sun. Now, I'm in the process of weeding clutter out. But I'm noticing that I have redundant set-ups that are probably hindering my work-flow.  Currently, I'm self-studying multiple languages &amp; teaching myself some coding. Starting this fall, I'll be a college student. If any of you were up to providing a stranger's perspective on my dilemma, I'd greatly appreciate it (sometimes you just need some input from someone who's not you). The stuff in bold is where I need help.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my current stack of apps (already drastically reduced, just need some help with the last few apps):

\- Anybox as link manager (replacement for [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io), DoMarks, mymind) 

\- Apple Notes for fleeting / fast notes, to track appointments (replaced Drafts, SimpleNote, Standard Notes...)

*Some overlap between these two, because they're both ""an inbox"". But IMO links tend to clutter my Apple Notes, so I think I'm fine with this.*

&amp;#x200B;

\- Things 3 for task management *(tried literally everything, this is by far the cleanest UI and most enjoyable to use)*

\- Freeform as a simple thinking / sketch-noting tool, maybe also some project management (creating overviews)

&amp;#x200B;

**- Readwise Reader or Matter for reading articles?** *I have a Readwise subscription (so just using Reader would make a lot of sense), but Matter has a much cleaner interface. Then again, Readwise Reader's feature set is not to be underestimated (especially being able to highlight / annotate YT videos). I don't tend to read that many articles via these apps anyway, so I guess it's not overly important for now.*

\- Bear for longer-form, Wiki-style notes (and creative writing). *I used Obsidian, Logseq, Athens, RemNote and others, but none of them come close to the simplicity and responsiveness of Bear... Although I wished Bear had backlinks, at least*

\- **Notion?** *Usually I would have a sort of Dashboard set-up in Notion, and also use it to take notes. I think it provides a nice visual overview of ongoing projects, and I also like taking notes in it. BUT I already have a project manager (Things 3) and a note-taker (Bear), so I'd probably benefit from not using Notion at all? On the other hand, I can imagine Bear becoming quite cluttered once I start uni... I fear that once I start using Notion more intensely, I will do again what I always do in Notion - overdo it and then stop using it altogether*

\- **GoodNotes** or **Notability?** *Even though I primarily type out notes, I do want to begin handwriting more once in university (because it's better for recall &amp; understanding). I used to switch between GN5 and Notability, because I simply can't decide. Notability has a cleaner folder hierarchy which I find appealing, and although my notes look somewhat ‚Äúless refined‚Äù , I feel as by focusing less on the aesthetic, their content is better somehow. But GN's general interface is nicer, and it syncs faster between Mac and iPad. It also now has audio notes, so that's no longer a reason for notability. I would only use either of these for school notes.*

\- **Anki** or **Mochi**? *I use active recall and spaced repetition for e.g. remembering vocabulary. I don't think I need to say much about Anki, but Mochi is essentially the love-child of Anki and a Markdown editor. You can take note-flashcards, also have nested decks etc. I like the idea of taking notes in the same app that I review them in, especially for languages this could come in handy. But again, I'm afraid of having a cross-over with Bear, GoodNotes. And I would only use Mochi offline on my Mac, because I already have enough subscriptions as is.*",6,17,2023-02-02 00:13:18,inbox cluttered,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/10r7x40/how_can_i_avoid_using_too_many_apps/
r/productivity,Wanted to fill everyone in on the system I use to be the most productive i've ever been in my life.,"So - thanks to /r/productivity I've been trying and experimenting with tons of tools to get organized. Since highschool this has been a major downfall. Now 25 and in a full time job/busy life - it's a major detriment to my work. 

I tried tons of to-do lists. Every single one of them. Google tasks, etc. 

I then shifted over to Evernote and read a few books on how to best use Evernote to stay organized/focused and categorize everything.

Evernote just didn't work for me. It was too much. I had too many tags, too many notebooks, too many stacks, and it inevitably ended up being what I wanted to avoid - cluttered. 

Not only that - The web app isn't great and i'm not particularly fond of the android app. They do great stuff on iOS and Mac but everything else left me feeling so 'meh.'

I then started to use Trello. (http://www.trello.com) 

Trello has organized my life and helped me get more done/reach more life goals than I ever have.

My system is as follows:

I have 'Boards' for my Personal Life, my freelance work, and my full time work. 

Inside of each I have the following Lists:

Inbox, Today, This Week, This Month, Done, Daily. 

Inbox - is just a general area for me to quickly jot things down that can be later organized and categorized. I try and keep ‚Äòideas‚Äô out of here and just leave Trello as a space for ‚Äòactionable‚Äô stuff. 

Today - is stuff that I absolutely have to get done today. 

This week - self explanatory.

Same with This Month.

Done - is critical for me. It‚Äôs important to be able to look through a long list and see all that i‚Äôve done. There‚Äôs also nothing more freeing than dropping something from ‚ÄòToday‚Äô all the way over to ‚Äòdone.‚Äô It‚Äôs one of the main rewards.

That's one of the issues I also had with To Do lists. The ‚Äòstrike through‚Äô wasn't that gratifying for me.  And it was harder to just scroll through and see all that you‚Äôve done. 

Daily - I use the color labels for this section. Yellow means not done - green means done. I keep all of my ‚Äòdaily personal goals‚Äô yellow until I complete one and then quickly label it green. For instance:

‚ÄúRead 30 minutes , take dog for walk, exercise, curse less, drink more water, check mint‚Ä¶‚Äù are all here. 

Now - one of the most critical parts of this system using Trello is to spend 15 minutes in the morning reviewing it. No distractions. I go through each and every board and just do an overall evaluation. It helps me keep the big picture in focus and push hard to achieve my goals. I do this around 5:30 am when our house is sleeping and I can just have my cup of coffee and focus on nothing but Trello. I don‚Äôt open reddit. No news. Absolutely nothing. It helps me immensely. You should do this too. 

I use Trello for ‚Äòactionable‚Äô items and Google Drive for most else. I take photos of all my receipts, transactions, bills, etc and store them in my ‚Äòfinances‚Äô folder. Googles image search is truly amazing. 

I have separate folders for ‚Äòthings I like‚Äô or ‚Äòplaces I want to travel‚Äô 

Google docs is very powerful for using things like this. Not only that - it‚Äôs cloud based (obviously). I also have different folders for everything (much like different boards) Personal - Freelance - Full Time job. I also have a folder just for my ‚Äòinbox‚Äô which are quick things to remember.

My main issue - Web clipper. There is no web clipper for GDrive (that works...well) and this I miss a ton from evernote. Saving stories/articles/etc. I suppose chrome just wants you to use bookmarks but I already have too many and i suppose this is one more thing i need to structure and organize.

Sorry if this is confusing to anyone. I am happy to take any questions. I hope this helps someone out.

However, I usually get 200-300 emails a day from these lists, and because people are human and fail to respond with the original subject, gmail fails to group a lot of the related conversations.

r/productivity,[Very Long] Getting Things Done in a Modern Paced World (A Guide to Task Organization Using Todoist),"In this modern paced world of ours, we are now no more than a screen away from 90% of all of the tasks we need to accomplish in our day to day lives. Phones have become high productivity devices, and anything you can‚Äôt do on a phone can be done on a tablet or laptop. This has allowed us to work anywhere and anytime. This is a problem for the strict Getting Things Done philosophy which has us put all our tasks into contexts so that we can only see work that can be done in the context we are currently in (thus removing clutter and keeping our focus only on those things which we can actually accomplish in our current setting). 

The problem with this, for me at least, is that my entire day is just one big context where I can be getting most anything done that is on my task list. I don't work well when staring at a giant list of things to do, so I need some way to pair down my tasks into smaller lists. However just making smaller lists doesn't really work well for me either, because I found myself spending way too much time re-organizing my small lists when an emergency task came up or when I needed to re-prioritize anything.  

The solution for me has been creating a system where I can keep my general todo list organization and task hierarchy separate from how I view my todos on a daily basis. To do this, I have used [Todoist](http://todoist.com). Todoist allows me to organize all of my tasks into different projects, and create a task hierarchy system that is great for viewing and monitoring entire projects. But it also allows me to create very custom tailored views into my task list, so that I can always know what specific tasks I should be working on. Plus it allows for very quick modification of those views, and what tasks show up in which view. 

The only downside is that the system I have developed requires Todoist Premium which costs $29 a year. I personally believe this tool, and what it can do, is well worth the price at less than $2.50 a month. They are constantly adding features and integrations with other software and I am happy to help support the further development of this awesome tool.

**Todoist**

For anyone that is unfamiliar with Todoist, let me outline the basic organizational method of Todoist. Tasks in todoist can be organized in four main ways.

* The first is through creating projects. Projects can be created to contain as many tasks as you like. Projects can also hold other projects, and can be nested 3 levels deep. 

* The second is through due dates. Todoist has the ability to set up due dates for any tasks. There are then some standard views which allow you to view tasks by due date, and you can have these tasks generate reminders before they are due, or when they are due. 

* The third is through labels. Any task can have any number of labels applied to that task. This labeling system is the main core of the system which I will outline later. 

* The fourth is through filters. These filters are the most powerful part of Todoist. You can set up filters that allow you to sort your tasks by any combination of labels, projects and due dates, and even set up single filters that sort into multiple lists with different criteria. I‚Äôll outline this further on. 

It is through the combination of the 4 above types of organization that allows each person to create their own unique system that works for them. So let's go ahead and outline how I have leveraged each one of these different organizational systems to organize my tasks. 

I do want to note here that this is not a tutorial on how to use the Todoist software. I will be going over broad concepts and how I organize my tasks. Todoist has some great help pages on its website and excellent customer support. Look there if you are confused on what buttons and things you need to press to do what I describe below. 

---

**Projects/Categories**

In setting up my organizational hierarchy, I like to start at the very top and organize my tasks into the broadest possible categories which I could filter them into. For me those categories were ‚ÄúWork‚Äù, ‚ÄúPersonal‚Äù, and ‚ÄúRecurring‚Äù. All the actionable tasks I ever will or might do fall under one of those three main categories (to be honest, they could all be fit under work or personal, but I like having my main recurring tasks visually separated).

These become the backbone of my project list. Then under each of these categories I have created sub categories and projects. For now I am mainly going to focus on the work category and how I organize my sub categories and projects for work. 

In my Work category, most of the subcategories fall under 2 different types. The first type is big work projects which have a final completion date (ex. Design Client Website). The second is big work projects which have no completion date (ex. Website Maintainance). Now instead of creating a third level of projects underneath these 2 types of projects, instead I use the project coloring system to indicate what type each project belongs to. So all large projects with a completion date have a blue dot, and all open ended projects have a green dot, and all of these projects go directly under the Work category. Then I also have some other sub categories under my main work category like ‚ÄúMeetings‚Äù and ‚ÄúErrands‚Äù which have their own color.

Overall, I like to keep my projects list as short as possible. This makes sorting tasks from the Todoist inbox much quicker and easier. 

**Nested Tasks**

I want to take a quick aside here to go over how I organize my tasks within a given project. Again the main key is hierarchy. For most of the big projects I complete I like to split those projects into smaller bite sized projects, and then split those bite sized projects into individual task lists. So for example let's take the ‚ÄúDesign Client Website‚Äù project. I might split that project into several major tasks like ‚ÄúSetup Server‚Äù, ‚ÄúConfigure Framework‚Äù, ‚ÄúCreate Content‚Äù and ‚ÄúReview With Client‚Äù. Under the ‚ÄúSetup Server‚Äù task I would then create all the sub tasks required to complete setting up the server, so that I can then get to the ‚ÄúConfigure Framework‚Äù stage. I will often nest tasks 4+ layers deep. Sometimes this can be annoying later on in the filtered views, but its not a huge problem. 

---

**Due Dates**

The second type of organization of tasks is through the very powerful due date system. This due date system is very useful for scheduling tasks which have exact dates associated with them. Along with the due dates comes reminders which can be set up to send you emails or send notifications to your phone. The coolest part of the due date feature is that you can simply type the due date in plain english and the system will almost always completely understand exactly what you mean. It‚Äôs much quicker than clicking through a calendar and then finding time fields to tab through. Its also smart enough to understand relative days and times like ‚ÄúNext Thursday Evening‚Äù. Very handy. 

I use due dates in two ways. The first is setting hard deadlines for tasks. If a task has a hard deadline, I want to make sure that I am aware of that deadline and am able to account for that in my weekly reviews. Every task that has a hard deadline, I set a due date with a specific time. 

The second type of due date is a reminder date or start date. Sometimes I want to associate a task with a specific day, much further in advance than what is available through my weekly agenda labels. I can do this by simply assigning that task to a specific day, but do not assign a time. This is handy because it is easy to see when I go to do a weekly review for the week when that task was assigned, and I will be able to easily schedule it from there. 

I want to make a general warning here. When I started using Todosit I foolishly gave nearly every task a due date. The problem with this is that if you miss that due date, you have to postpone that task or reschedule the due date. Plus any tasks that didn‚Äôt get done on one day show up at the top of the general ‚ÄúToday‚Äù list as overdue, and they go all red and send you notifications that they were overdue, and for me that was really stressful. Most of those projects didn‚Äôt actually have a hard deadline or due date. Instead, I found using the labeling system with the agenda labels much more useful and didn‚Äôt make me feel like I had cheated my own system when I didn‚Äôt get a particular task done on the assigned day and postponed it for later. 

---

**Labels**

Next let's talk about labels. I have 3 main types of labels and again I like to organize these label types using the colors. Also, there is no nesting of labels so the colors are pretty much the only way to organize them. The 3 main types of labels I use are ‚Äútask duration‚Äù labels, ‚Äúagenda‚Äù labels, and ‚Äútime of day‚Äù labels. Let me describe each. 

Task duration labels are labels which describe the approximate time it should take to complete the task. I use 5m, 15m, 30m, 60m, and gt_60m as my labels. The last one meaning ‚ÄúGreater than 60m‚Äù. These labels really help when I am doing my daily or weekly review as it allows me to better schedule my tasks and gives a nice overview of how much work I have scheduled for a given day. It‚Äôs also useful to give myself some variety. I always try to schedule a few 5m and 15m projects every day as it gives me something to do to take a break away from my main projects. Its nice to be able to see them and distribute them throughout my week. 

Agenda labels are labels which I use to assign the days I want to work on certain tasks. I have an overarching label called ‚ÄúThis_Week‚Äù Which I use to pull together all the projects and tasks I want to work on in a given week. This tag is crucial when doing my weekly review. It allows me to see all the incomplete tasks from the previous week, and allows me to easily prioritize and distribute tasks for the upcoming week. In addition to the ‚ÄúThis_Week‚Äù label, I have a label for each day of the week (I combine saturday and sunday into a label called ‚ÄúWeekend‚Äù because I like to keep my weekends much more loose and relaxed). When I am doing my weekly review I will assign each task or small project with a label for the day I want to complete that task or set of tasks. This helps me make sure that I evenly distribute my tasks for the week and allows me to create separate views for each weekday. I also use a ‚ÄúToday‚Äù label which can be useful later when creating filters, although keeping this label up to date can be a bit time consuming in your daily review.

Time of day labels are labels which I use to further assign tasks within each day. These are labels like ‚Äúmorning‚Äù, ‚Äúbefore lunch‚Äù, ‚Äúlunch break‚Äù, ‚Äúafter lunch‚Äù, and ‚Äúevening‚Äù. I don‚Äôt always use these labels, but when I do, they can be very useful in cases where I have some sort of task that needs to be done in a particular part of the day. A good example of this is if you are on the west coast and need to make a phone call to a company on the east coast. This task would warrant a ‚Äúbefore lunch‚Äù label so that you prioritize that task properly. Or if you have to go to the bank you could assign the ‚Äúlunch break‚Äù label so that you can remember to do that while the bank is open during the day. Using these labels instead of strict due dates/times is beneficial when creating views later on. It keeps your day loosely organized without any forced pressure from the due date, and it makes it easier to organize and create more specific views. 

In addition to the labels above, I also have several other labels. I use a ‚ÄúReview‚Äù label to easily tag and sort my daily and weekly review items. I have a ‚ÄúWaiting_For‚Äù label which I use to tag tasks where I am waiting on someone else. There are plenty of other little labels which can be handy in certain situations where you want to sort some specific subset of tasks across several of your projects. There is a list of some other useful labels at the end of this article.  

---

**Filters**

Ok, so this is part that we have been building to. Everything above has been set up so that you can create views that are perfect for whatever situation you are in. I hardly ever go back to project views anymore unless I am actually outlining a project and all the tasks for that project. Most days I am simply looking at filters. 

In this case I am going to explain some of the details on how to create filters, since the Todoist help is pretty sparse when it comes to explaining how to set up filters and queries. 

So filters consist of two things. The first is the filter name (and color). The second is the filter query. You can name your filters whatever you want, but the tricky bit is creating the queries. Most queries you will want to create are made up of multiple parts. So let‚Äôs say you want to make a view that shows all of your work tasks for wednesday. This means we want to see all the tasks with the label @Wednesday that are within the Work category. The queries understand basic programming operators, so for this example we are going to use the ‚Äú&amp;‚Äù character to define all tasks that have both the @Wednesday label AND are within the work category. We designate labels with the @ sign and designate projects with the prefix ‚Äúp:‚Äù So to create a filter for all work tasks on wednesday we would write:

    @Wednesday &amp; p:Work

Again, this shows tasks that both have the @wednesday label AND are in the Work category. 

Let‚Äôs take another, more complex example. Let‚Äôs say we want to see all tasks that have the @Wednesday label AND are in the Meetings project OR tasks that have the @Wednesday label AND are in the Web Design project. That query would look like this:

    (@Wednesday &amp; p:Meetings) | (@Wednesday &amp; p:Web Design)

As you can see the pipe symbol ‚Äú|‚Äù is used to show an OR statement. 

Another thing we can do is create a view which contains multiple queries. For example, look at the following query:

    (Today &amp; p:Work), (@Wednesday &amp; @Before_Lunch &amp; p:Work), (@Wednesday &amp; @After_Lunch &amp; p:Work)

This will create a filter that has 3 lists of tasks (each list query is separated with a comma). At the top will be all the tasks in the work project which have today as their due date (from the due date system). Then there will be a list of all work related tasks with the @Wednesday label AND the @Before_Lunch label. Then there will be a list of all work related tasks with the @Wednesday label AND the @After_Lunch label. 

As you can see, these filters can be very simple, or they can be very complex. This is the power of Todoist and this system. Here is a list of some of the major views which I use:

**This Week** 

    @This_Week
Shows all of the tasks which I have assigned the the @This_Week label

**Monday - Work**

    (Today &amp; p:Work), (@Monday &amp; p:Work)
Shows all the work related tasks that have today as their due date, and then all the work related tasks which I assigned the @Monday label (I would have done this during my weekly or daily review)

**Lunch Break**

    (@Lunch_Break), (p:Errands)
This shows a list of tasks with the lunch break label, and then also shows all my tasks in the ‚ÄúErrands‚Äù project. 

**Today**

    (Today &amp; p:Work), (Today &amp; p:Personal)
This shows a list of all the work related tasks which are due today, and then shows another list of all my personal tasks which are due today.

**5m - Work**

    (@5m &amp; @This_Week &amp; p:Work)
This shows all the work related tasks which I want to get done this week and should only take 5 minutes or less

**Morning**

    (@Today &amp; @Morning &amp; p:Work)
This shows all the work related tasks to which I assigned both the @Today label and the @Morning label

---

**Conclusion**

That‚Äôs the basics of how I organize and view all of my tasks using Todoist. Using this method, I have found that I am able to have a todo list for almost every situation, and once you get the hang of how to make filters it is very easy to take 2 minutes during your weekly or daily review to make a custom filter for any unusual situations you may find yourself in. Like being stuck on an airplane or some other unusual environment. 

This is where task management needs to be headed. Restricting your todo list to rigid contexts is a failing proposition in today‚Äôs mobile age. Instead we need a system which allows us to categorize tasks in many different ways, and then provides a way to easily see the tasks that fit whatever situation we happen to be in. 

The next time I post, I'll go over how I actually use this system in my daily and weekly reviews, and just how simple it can be to organize all your tasks and keep your filters up to date.

r/productivity,A Free Solution to Email Apps,"So I have been watching a lot of the main Youtuber channels introduce all the Email apps recently (and with the particular mention of Hey). 

The problem is, as a student I simply don't get enough emails to justify spending even ¬£5 per month let alone the inflating costs of some apps designed for bussinesses or super users. However, I still wanted an application that was better looking than the Office Outlook or web based Gmail that was my only choice. 

**My solution: utilising the free Missive version and turning the limitation into a productivty feature.** 

In short, they provide a personal user all the features but limit the use to a 15 day history (i.e. you can only see emails relevent to the past 15 days). This has been ironically really useful to de-clutter my inbox and provide a service as my daily app for checking incoming emails.

If I need to find an email before this period I can resort to Outlook but this has been fairly rare so far as most of my on-going work will keep the conversation chain relevent.

Now that little counter has a HUGE number that I want to go away.

I'd like to start clearing out some of the clutter to increase my productivity and stop fearing my inbox.

r/productivity,Getting things done with Filofax Refillable Notebook,"I've read some bits and pieces on here about the Getting Things Done concept, which I thought might help me.  
I did some research, I didn't read any of the books but I found some images that briefly explained the process so I thought I'd try to implement them by myself and go back to the books if I get stuck. 
I tried a couple of different apps to aid the process but none of them felt like the right fit. I kept fighting with my own obsession to get things perfectly right the first time and I got caught up in learning how to be productive rather than be productive. 

I have a bit of an obsession with notebooks and diaries and if I start writing in one and it isn't quite right, I have to buy a new one to start a new system (the clean slate idea). This really holds me back because I never get stuck into a system because it never feels like it fits with my lifestyle. 

Today, I've tried again. I had a wander around the stationers in search of a shiny new notebook, and I think I found it. 

Filofax Refillable Notebook. 
The pages are easily removable and positionable so if I write something ""out of order"" I can just put it in its rightful place. 

The notebook also has four dividers. So I have sectioned the book as follows:
Section 1 - Schedule (Diary/Calendar)
Section 2 - Inbox (This is just stuff to be organised)
Section 3 - Defer (To Do List/Shopping Lists/Projects) 
Section 4 - Reference 

I also bought myself a four colour pen, to colour code my notes. 
Black - Information
Blue - Action 
Red - Urgent Action 
Green - Pending Event/Action 

I expect there will be issues to work out along the way but so far it seems hopeful. 

The inbox is just a dumping ground for all thoughts and ideas, but having visibility of all the crap helped me make sense of what was going on. 
It reminded me of things that I needed to do that would only take a couple of minutes, so I've managed to clear off a few things already. 
The reference section is also really handy because I can forget about things knowing they're stored safely at the back of my notebook for when I need them. 

I rely quite heavily on my phone calendar for all the big events but the calendar in section 1 is also useful for fitting in the little bits like food shopping, clothes washing and household chores. I don't want this stuff cluttering my main diary as you lose visibility of the overall week. 

I also use Evernote for some of my bigger projects.... but it's so slow that it just doesn't work for quick notes and when it slows me down I get frustrated. 
A productivity app shouldn't hinder the process let alone slow you down. 

So this is my new project, I just hope it actually works this time! ",14,7,2018-07-10 00:26:08,inbox cluttered,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/8xgfw1/getting_things_done_with_filofax_refillable/

But there are a lot of ways to do that sort of thing.

r/productivity,The Only Productivity Hack That Really Matters - Sleep Optimization,"I get it, the productivity space is all about using tools and shortcuts to get as much sh\*t done as quickly and effectively as possible. 

However, let me tell you that **Sleep is the key to unlock effective and sustainable productivity**.   
There‚Äôs an abundance of information across scientific literature that highlights sleep as the biggest catalyst in performance - both physical and cognitive. 

Now that we cleared that, let‚Äôs get down to the brass tacks.   
**Two critical productivity concepts to grasp:**

**Circadian Rhythm**

* Think of the Circadian Rhythm as your biological daily energy schedule shaped as a rolling wave that peaks and dips across the day. 
* During your Circadian Peaks, which, for many, fall in the late morning and late afternoon, every cell in your body is programmed to be alert and ready to perform. 
* Conversely, during your Circadian Dip, which generally occurs in the early afternoon, your body is naturally programmed to be relaxed and in recovery. 

**Sleep Debt**

* Sleep debt refers to the cumulative hours of sleep lost over a period of approximately two weeks, relative to your own sleep needs. The more sleep debt you carry the more likely you are to see a dip in your daily productivity (common sense).

**How to Leverage Your Circadian Rhythm for Peak Productivity:**

* **Morning ramp-up:** Wake up and get your lymphatic system moving and your mindset in check. As your energy rises, plan the day ahead.
* **Morning peak:** Reserve this time for complex work that demands your highest level of focus, such as important activities that require high emotional fortitude and brain cycle allocation.
* **Afternoon dip:** This is a good time to tackle passive administrative tasks like emails or CRM updates. Depending on your schedule, you could try to squeeze in a workout or take a little siesta.
* **Evening peak**: Last peak of the day, so make it count. Knock out a couple more deliverables and tasks that require a high level of focus or collaborative effort. 
* **Evening wind-down:** Time to ramp down, unplug, and relax. Do not ignore your wind-down window as it is the precursor for a good night sleep. You should take steps to ensure you have a consistent easing-off-into-bed ritual. Remember, recovery is crucial for productivity.

**Sleep Optimization Tips To Reduce Sleep Debt:**

* Start using blue light protection glasses if you spend too much time staring at screens. A cheap pair from [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) will get the job done.
* Integrate gamification in your stack. On this, there are many apps to choose from. I like [Risescience.com](https://Risescience.com).
* Cold is your friend. Keep your bedroom on the colder side. It will enhance your sleep.

  
**Jumping Over Hundred Dollar Bills To Pick Up Nickels**

Very often, I see people (fellow entrepreneurs mostly), stacking up on the latest productivity tools and supplements in an attempt to gain that extra edge.

Unfortunately what most of these good folks need is a good sleep hygiene habit. **Don‚Äôt fall victim to the hype**. Get your sleep in order first.

* **""I literally can't even tell what I'm feeling righ now""**: Like the right-below-mentioned mindmap app, but this time on a scrap paper. Instead of actively trying to make a structured map or to figure out ""what to do next"", I just write absolute nonsense onto a shitty scrap of paper I know I'll throw out. I'll write things like ""I feel hungry."" and then realize I'm actually hungry and that's why I can't think for shit. Or ""Debra still needs to email me her reply"" and just voicing that helps give that cycling thought an outlet, so I can move on and focus on something else. I like keeping a big scrappy ""school-workbook"" to a college I never went to, as I can write/doodle in it without worrying about making something nice-looking. It's the unfiltered braindump recepticle. 

^TL;DR: ^Braindumping.

* **""My Brain is Full of Bees"":**  I use ""MiMind"" Mindmapping to help me braindump a bajillion buzzing thoughts onto a single 'board'. MiMind specifically allows me to make unstructured mindmaps, so I don't have to come up with a 'master' node to link everything to. I can just make a random floating bubble anywhere on the board, and THEN eventually link it to something when I realize ""Oh X task is related to Y over here, actually"" or ""I want to do XYZ, but ABC is preventing me from doing that so looks like I have to do ABC first."" This helps alleviate the feeling of chaotic-stress or ""too much going on"".


^TL;DR: ^Mindmapping.

* **""What the fuck am I doing next again?""**: Workflowy is a free *minimalist* list-tree app that I use as both a Masterlist for references I need (A list of addresses, links, projects, goals, emails, task-trees, etc) and as a way to turn a series of tasks into a linear step-by-step. They recently implimented a function that allows you to make ""boards"" you can drag and drop lists into. I've been using a three-section board of *""Do Soon""*, *""Do Eventually""*, and *""Would be Neat""* to help me separate tasks. Do-soon is stuff I'm either doing TODAY or this-week, or ought to do next. ""Do Eventually"" is for things that either aren't time sensitive, or I can't pursue yet because something else has to be done first. ""Would be Neat"" is for everything else -- like things that would be nice to have but aren't immediately pressing nor life-changingly important. If you had to pick only one tool, I vouch Workflowy, as it's also *free* and you can use it across both PC and phones. It's minimalist built is also incredibly ADHD friendly, and fast enough to launch that I don't get distracted before I get to insert something.

^TL;DR: ^Section ^tasks ^as ^""Do ^Soon, ^Do ^Eventually, ^Would ^be ^neat"".

* **""I keep losing track of all this important shit"":** Learning Gsheets and how to make aesthetically legible charts is not just a work-transferrable skill, but absolutely fucking crucial to craft your own ADHD-Reference ""Masterbook of Important Shit"". I've created myself a single massive document with different tabs for different topics, like my own personal financial-tracking, my long-term project aspirations, a reference list of all the Zoom links I need  to have on-hand (and to who/what they're tied to). You can make a bajillion different tabs all in the same file, color-code them, and adjust them to your hyper-specific needs. You won't make your first sheet into a work of art -- you're going to make a lot of shitty ones first. But over time you'll learn what worked, what doesn't work, and what needs you actually have. The Gsheet community is very helpful too, and learning how to create a sublime reference sheet for yourself will free up a lot of our valuable-and-lacking mental RAM-space. I *know* I'm not going to remember what email I received the Zoom Meeting link in -- but I also *know* which tab I need to open in order to find it. Having ADHD means we have to *constantly* externalize what we ""know"" into ""I know where to find it.""

^TL;DR: ^Externalize ^your ^knowledge/information-needs ^onto ^one ^Gsheet ^with ^sectioned ^tabs.

* **""Why can't I fucking get started on this"":** TimeTimer is a free app that compensates a crucial ADHD problem: our inability to have a sense of time. We have ""Now"" or ""Not Now"" as our sense of timing, and ""Forever"" or ""Nothing"" as our sense of how long something will take. TimeTimer externalizes our sense of time into a *visual shrinking pie-chart* that cures the procrastination-anxiety that manifests when we feel that something will take forever to do. Dishes that feel endless suddenly feel easy to do when you have a visual timer indicating ""15 minutes"" that's shrinking down. Being able to visually see time disappearing, really helps to motivate yourself to pursue a task and to make said task appear a lot less all-consuming. We freeze when we can't see the end to a task/project, a visual timer gives us freedom and clarity of mind when we're like this. Numbers counting down is still too 'abstract' for a lot of us, but seeing something shrink down over time gives a much more concrete sense of time.

^TL;DR: ^Visual ^Timers ^((shrinking pie-charts, hourglasses) ^) ^removes ^time-anxiety.

* **""I keep fucking wandering off mid-task"":** Junebugging is a concept where you ""assign"" yourself an anchor point. Say you want to clean the dishes but keep wandering off; you make the kitchen sink your ""Anchor point."" You get started on the dishes, but something distracts you (like taking out the trash) so you wander off to remove the trash. Eventually you'll remember ""oh yeah I'm Junebugging"" and you return to the sink. Your work-process is going to look Chaotic as Fuck from the outside, but you'll *eventually* finish the dishes, AND have accomplished a bunch of random tasks surrounding that physical space (trash, cleaning the oven, changing out the dishtowels, changing lightbulbs, sweeping). Having ADHD involves accepting that you'll have SOME 'wandering off', but we can guide our hurricane-of-chaotic-attention to specific areas/topics versus punishing ourselves for being unable to focus on One Thing. The next-level refinement of Junebugging is taking a day to deliberately list yourself a bunch of 'cluster tasks' you can do together and default to when junebugging. You can also apply this to digital programs/folders/emails, though I recommend an external post-it note reminder of what you're presently junebugging, for lack of physical anchor.

^TL;DR: ^Junebugging.

* **""I fucking hate alarms but I need alarms"":** I only recently found this but I like it immensely; TimeTune allows you to create *clusters* of alarms you can turn on/off. I have alarm/audio-notifications set to go off 5 minutes before specific meetings, specific time-sensitive work-events, to remind me to *prepare* for work, and even to go off when work itself starts *and* ends. Timetune allows you to turn off entire routines of alarms (so if you have a day off you don't have to remove 10 alarms at once and remember to add 10 alarms the next day), and it allows you to choose much less obstructive sound-cues if you just need a quick audible beep versus a much more unpleasant and invasive wakeup-alarm. While getting visual notifications (at first) seems like an obvious ADHD solution, we risk getting ""Notification Overload"" where we just start dismissing notifications without even reading or noticing them. Timetune gives you the breathing-room of just a quick reminder-beep or chime without demanding your full attention and disrupting you from your workflow. 

^TL;DR: ^use ^cluster ^alarms/notification ^apps ^that ^are ^pleasant ^to ^use.

* **""What am I even doing with my life"":** Physical agenda books. *""I get started on them but I never use them after""* -- Then you don't have the agenda book that fits your needs. There's planners out there that split up days into hourly sections, and include monthly journal-like check-ins where you can look back and assess what worked, what didn't work, and if you're pursuing things that are aligning to your own personal goals/desires along with reminders to appreciate the people around you. I vouch for PassionPlanner, personally, but I've also moved on to finding other Agenda planners that you can order online, that allow you to choose the layout of your pages. (I wanted a minimalist planner that gives me space for notes but also has days sectioned by half-hours, for example). In addition, *find the pens that you want to use.* It has to feel good for us to use it. I also enjoy the excuse of slapping in stickers on everything, but that's just me. You have to turn your planner into something you have fun using, and *want to use.* Some people prefer undated planners, because we might 'skip' a few months and then feel bad about 'wasting' these months, but with an undated planner, you can just resume on your last page and write in the next few dates. The useage of stickers motivates me to actively add in distant/future meetings &amp; events, and gives me an excuse to open the book frequently enough to track my life.

^TL;DR: ^Find ^the ^planner ^that ^works ^for ^YOU ^specifically.

* **""Seriously, I'm just repeating in cycles"":** Less a ""thing"" and more a philosophy; we are often trapped by our past habits and past lifestyles, traumas, habit patterns, etc. ""What we spend mental energy on is what we become"" in a *very* simplified version of a bigger idea, but; what's the solution to that? *Pull from the future.* Think about who you want to become, where you want to be. Think about the possible paths you would need to take to get there. Would it take therapy? Community support? Getting fit? Switching careers? The danger of introspection is we can get caught-up in how we *were* that we forget to look to who we could *become.* It gets a lot easier to pursue new habits, new efforts, when we can actually identify if we're on ""the right track"" or not.

^TL;DR: ^Read/Listen-to-Audiobook ^""Unfuck ^Yourself""/ ^Be ^inspired ^by ^your ^future ^ideal ^self.

* **""My Name's Jared &amp; I can't Read"":** Trust me; subscribing to a cheap audiobook platform is lifechanging. I'm speaking as someone who *also* has a hearing disability; the benefit of an audiobook platform is that you can repeat the same book multiple times over, with no effort. You can use audiobooks as background noise to 'pad' unpleasant tasks like chores, dishes, and feed yourself media while doing something unpleasant or time-consuming. Plus, instead of impulse-purchasing fifty self-help books with only one or two you might skim through, having a portable book platform (like Scribd) lets you test-run as many self-help/productivity books as you want, without feeling like you 'have' to use this specific book if you don't vibe with it.

r/productivity,"Can‚Äôt leave my phone alone, help!","Hi, 36 year old FTM/SAHM here. I‚Äôm really struggling with phone addiction atm, my screen time is anywhere between 6-10 hours a day and I‚Äôm at the end of my tether and can‚Äôt seem to stop. It‚Äôs really just taking over my life which sounds dramatic but it‚Äôs true. I‚Äôve tried several things previously and none of them stick. 

I‚Äôve read the book ‚Äòhow to break up with your phone‚Äô (lasted about 2 weeks then habits crept back in), I‚Äôve tried screen time limits, I‚Äôve tried brick, I‚Äôve tried greyscale/dumbing down my phone/ I‚Äôve tried various apps. These solutions never stick and I end up back in bad habits. 

I feel like there was me before phone addiction - someone who was happy, excited for life, then me post phone addiction, struggling with low mood, low motivation and struggle to focus and be productive. 

My biggest problems are instagram/FB reels, I try deleting the apps but end up just downloading them again when I‚Äôm bored. I feel like I‚Äôm not as present as I should be with my baby and my house is always a mess and I‚Äôm forever agitated and overwhelmed because nothing ever gets done, and I blame it on the fact ‚Äòim a busy mum‚Äô but the reality is I spend too much time doom scrolling over tasks around the house. Even when I delete the apps, I find myself just picking up my phone and opening my email or looking at news websites/pinterest. 

I‚Äôve thought about buying a dumb phone but the reality is I need a smart phone. Theres too many things in this modern day where its just practical to have a smart phone (eg apple pay/maps/wallet/ticket QR codes/whatsapp etc etc) has anybody been in my situation and turned it around?

r/productivity,Working for Agile/SCRUM startup helped me realize why I PROCRASTINATED in the past and how I fixed it.,"I experienced procrastination the most during my university years. It seems high school and university students are still facing this challenge the most. When I browse through reddit, it‚Äôs astonishing how severe this problem is for many of them.¬†

Looking back to my university years, I can understand what was going on and why procrastination was such a big problem for me.¬† **I** **simply** **had too much time to get my tasks done.** Yeap. You heard it. I had too much time to complete my homework or to prepare for my exams. I had the luxury of time. And **I could afford to spend time on procrastination.** But of course, back then I thought that I was busy. I worked part time since the second year of university. I always had a job on a side. I thought I was busy with school and with work. But in reality, I was not. I gave myself too much time to get things done.¬†

I realized I only had a problem of procrastination when I was doing homework. Guess what, **I had zero procrastination during the exam time**. You remember what I‚Äôm talking about. You walk into this huge auditorium; they sit you down and give you an exam booklet. Then they start the countdown. Sometimes it‚Äôs a big clock. Sometimes they write the time on a board. But you see that you only have 2 or 3 hours to get this exam done.

**And never in my life did I see a student who struggled with procrastination during an exam.**

Everyone starts writing the moment they say ‚Äúgo‚Äù. These are the exact same students who‚Äôve been suffering from procrastination for the entire semester. Then they walk into this room and wow, their procrastination disease is cured. Why is that? Because they only have 2 hours to get this exam done. And they have no time to waste.¬†

# Agile/SCRUM Teams

This is also the reason **why Agile and SCRUM became so popular in the tech world**. The team only has a short amount of time (called a sprint) to get major improvements done. In contrast, big corporations loooove long-term planning and long-term projects. They give themselves years to get stuff done. No wonder, they never meet the deadlines.¬† **When you give yourself too much time, you have time to procrastinate. You have a lot of time to create a lot of drama about your work.**¬†All that overthinking, over-analyzing, over-researching. And the funny thing is even if we give ourselves a lot of time, we end up doing the task at the very end, in a very short period of time. The rest of the time is spent on drama.¬† I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard of **the Parkinson Law.** Work expands to fill the time allotted. If you think you can do a task in a week, you are right. If you think you can do this task in a day, you are also right.¬†

# The State of Flow

About two years ago, everyone wanted to reach the state of flow. This idea was first proposed in a book called ‚ÄúFlow‚Äù by the author with the last name noone can pronounce. Well only the lazy one wasn‚Äôt talking about this book in their book reviews videos.¬† And people tried to find different complicated ways to get to this magic state of flow.¬† But you know what I‚Äôve found? **It is very easy to be in the state of flow when you give yourself little time to get your tasks done.** It works like crazy! All the inner chatter is gone the moment you realize that you only have an hour to write that blogpost or to prepare that report. Try it for yourself! It‚Äôs free! And it‚Äôs very effective.¬†

# You Can Enjoy Your Life

Another amazing thing about giving yourself tight timelines is that you can actually enjoy your life. You have time available for leisure. For fun. For family and friends. And you don‚Äôt need to think about all the tasks you should be doing because you got them done in the scheduled time block. Or you know that they are on your schedule and you will get them done tomorrow.

# Time Blocking

I recommend scheduling your tasks in 30-minute increments. Some tasks might take longer. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend anything longer than 90 minutes. **Plan for the results, not the activities**. Instead of ""working on the blogpost"", put ‚Äúpublish a blogpost‚Äù.¬†

Reducing the amount of time you give yourself to complete a task **helps with perfectionism**. If you know that you only have an hour to write and publish your blog post, you don‚Äôt waste an hour on choosing the perfect cover image.¬†

I also like that I don‚Äôt have to keep thinking about my tasks. I know it‚Äôs in my schedule, so **I don‚Äôt need to have all the drama in my head** of how i‚Äôm not good enough because I haven‚Äôt completed these tasks yet. I know that they will get done when it‚Äôs time to get them done. Why bother worrying about them now?

# How to Start

If you are new to time blocking and scheduling, I recommend using the concept of **anchoring up**. It means, you need to have an external commitment to get your work done by a specific time. It‚Äôs like having a deadline for your assignment back in university days. A professor always gives a specific time you should submit your assignment by. If you are a student, find a buddy.

Let‚Äôs say you have a term paper to write. Agree that by Monday noon you will email each other your outlines. By Wednesday noon, you will email each other the literature review section. By Friday noon, you will write your introduction and conclusion. You get the idea. Break the major project down to the tasks that can be done in a few hours and create a deadline for those.

**I recommend having a deadline at 12 pm**. You can get your most important task done in the morning and then enjoy the rest of your day guilt-free. Otherwise, you will spend an entire day anticipating this task and it‚Äôs just not fun.¬†

I‚Äôve used this approach in my grad school. And I was able to finish grad school one semester earlier. And I never did any school work past 4-5 pm. This stuff does work.

Of course, this idea applies to everyone, not just students. Create not only a *date* deadline, create a *time* deadline for your task. *‚ÄúI will create and submit my quarterly report to my manager by 3 pm on Thursday.‚Äù* And don‚Äôt give yourself the luxury of time. **Time is only useful when you are resting and recharging. Giving yourself too much time on work or school stuff is never a good idea,** in my experience. It only leads to procrastination, useless perfectionism, drama, and confusion.¬†

# Conclusion

If you procrastinate doing something, it‚Äôs probably because you gave yourself too much time. Or too much ambiguity. Break your tasks down into 30 to 60-minute increments. Put them on your schedule. Plan for the results you will produce in that 30- or 60-minute interval. And be done with these tasks when the time is up. **It doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect. It** **just** **needs to** **be done.**¬†

r/productivity,How to type fast (from someone who types 145 words per minute),"&amp;#x200B;

*If you‚Äôd like something more visual, where it‚Äôs probably a lot easier to explain a few things, you can check out the* [*YouTube video*](https://youtu.be/4jeldNi_cy8) *I made about this.*

## Why typing faster will actually change your life

Even if you only improve a bit, typing faster is something that will improve your productivity massively. Let me demonstrate with some interesting statistics.

* The average typist types 3,500 words a day
* The average typing speed is 41 wpm - which means that on average, this typist would type for 85 minutes a day.
* However, if you were to type at 120wpm, then **that means you would instead type that 3500 words in only 29.16 minutes a day**.

Of course, like many things in life, the cumulative effect of this over time is massive:

* By increasing typing speed from 41wpm to 120wpm, it means that you would save **20381.60 mins** of time a year.
* That‚Äôs equivalent to a whopping **339.69 hours a year**
* To put that into perspective, an anime episode is roughly 20 minutes. That‚Äôs about 1019.07 episodes of anime = 78.38 *seasons* of anime.
* Or, for a regular 30 minute TV show, that‚Äôs 679.38 episodes of whatever it is you happen to like binging.

## A quick primer on touch typing

To quickly go over basics: touch typing is basically where you type without looking. You can feel these two little ridges on the f and j keys respectively, where you rest your index fingers. This will always orientate you to the keyboard. Use your thumb for space bar.

* Try practicing hitting alternating f and then g but just with your left index finger and without looking.
* Try practicing hitting alternating j and then h but just with your left index finger and without looking.

Then, you can practice the other letters of the index finger.

* Try hitting t, g, and b, all with your left index finger.
* Then y, h, n, all with your right index finger.
* Then r, v, with your left index finger.
* Then u, m, with your right index finger.

After that, try the middle finger buttons:

* d, e, c
* k, I, and comma

Then the ring finger buttons:

* s, w, x
* o, l, .
* To be honest, I tend to use my right ring finger to hit ‚Äú;‚Äù, and also to hit the quotation marks keys (because I use my right pinky to simultaneously hit the Shift key).  I also use it for backspace.
* Similarly, I also use my left ring finger sometimes to hit q, a, z ‚Äî the reason being that I can hold down the Shift key on the left hand side with my pinky finger in order to type QAZ capitalised with one hand. But if capitalisation is not needed, then you can just feel free to your pinky finger (e.g. it‚Äôs really natural if you have your index finger already on f, because you literally just press down on your pinky finger).

The pinky is actually the hardest finger to control (I find). I tend to use it mainly for the biggest buttons only: like Enter, the Shift on the left, etc. Even when hitting letters like p, it‚Äôs so much easier to just shift to hitting the P with the ring finger so that you can use your other fingers to hit other stuff (e.g. ‚Äúpotato‚Äù ==&gt; P right ring finger, O right middle finger, T left index finger, A left pinky finger, T left index, O right ring finger).

Changing positions for the same key can also make things easier/quicker: for example, hitting O in potato twice, actually you can change from middle finger to ring finger. This is a technique that is also used in piano to hit the same note rapidly, as it‚Äôs actually kinda hard to do an up and down motion really quickly.

**If none of this makes sense, don‚Äôt worry: probably a much more intuitive way to explain it is just to try it using a typing program, which I‚Äôll explain below.**

When you get your fingers in the right places, you‚Äôll find that the rest is really just muscle memory and practice. Keep at it!

## Places you can learn to type

Back in the day, I used to play a game called Garfield Teaches Typing, but that used to use Flash Player (RIP). However, there's a cool website called typingclub.com which does something very similar to what that program used to do, which is to help you practice particular keys (which I think is probably one of the best ways to get used to the motions).

There‚Äôs also websites like:

* [TypeRacer](https://play.typeracer.com) \- which lets you race against other people in the world
* [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com) \- a nicely designed website which gives you a graph of your speed.

But ultimately, what I found most beneficial for typing was the rush of having to type fast in games. In my particular case, I used to play a game called Puzzle Pirates (which still exists) and you‚Äôd be rapidly trying to communicate with your teammates whilst doing puzzles. Sometimes blogging and that sort of thing also helps: just anything enjoyable where you can get practice doing so. But in terms of time to effort, learning on a website like typingclub and actually practicing the movements so that you use all five fingers to some degree will really help.

## Learning to navigate the keyboard better

A lot of people don‚Äôt necessarily know much about shortcuts - beyond the basic Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V (or Cmd+C and Cmd+V on Mac) - but there‚Äôs ways that you can move around textual documents significantly faster. You‚Äôll find that even if you‚Äôre just using your computers for email or messaging, learning these shortcuts instead of using a mouse will help your ability to create and type things drastically.

## Mac Keyboard Shortcuts

Opt + left or right arrow: Move between words Opt + up or down arrow: Move between lines Cmd + left or right arrow: Move between lines Cmd + up or down arrow: Move to bottom or top of page Holding shift with any of the above: Select text as well

Cmd + A: Highlight all Cmd + Tab: Alternate between open apps

Cmd + C: Copy Cmd + X: Cut (this can be pasted) Cmd + V: Paste WITH formatting Shift + Opt + Cmd + V: Paste WITHOUT formatting

Cmd + Backspace: Delete whole line Opt + Backspace: Delete whole word Cmd + Z: Undo Cmd + Y: Redo Cmd + B: Bold Cmd + I: Italic Cmd + U: Underline

## Windows Keyboard Shortcuts

Because I have a Mac, a lot of this video talks about Mac-specific keyboard shortcuts. But here are some of the Windows equivalents (instead of using the Option key):

Ctrl + Left arrow key: Move the cursor to the beginning of the previous word. Ctrl + Right arrow key: Move the cursor to the beginning of the next word. Ctrl + Up arrow key: Move the cursor to the beginning of the previous paragraph Ctrl + Down arrow key: Move the cursor to the beginning of the next paragraph. Ctrl + Shift + Arrow key: Select block of text.

A lot of the rest are similar except basically you just replace ""Cmd"" with ""Ctrl"".

## Look for alts

Some programs will let you use custom keypresses in the actual program. On some Windows programs, you can reveal the shortcuts by holding ‚ÄòAlt‚Äô, and then some letters will be underlined: if you press down Alt and that letter, then it is actually the shortcut for that particular action. On a Mac, the shortcuts are usually revealed when you use the Menu Bar at the top and then look at the symbols next to the individual item.

## Open programs quicker

An interrelated tip: using a program like Alfred (on Mac OS) will also make navigating your computer itself much quicker, meaning that you would use your mouse even less and can open a certain program as soon as you think of it. On Windows, if you simply use the Windows key it will also let you quickly type in and access a program quickly, too (I‚Äôm not sure if Windows has a good equivalent to Alfred).

# Do I need a fancy keyboard? 

I personally like using gaming keyboards (my favorite keyboard switch being the Cherry MX Brown) as the keys are more springy and ""clackety"" for lack of a nicer word. I feel as if it's been a great investment. Personally, I use a Kinesis Gaming Freestyle Edge keyboard, but that's a bit weird and expensive; the reason I use this particular keyboard is that I type so much that ergonomics and therefore having a natural wrist position is really important to me -- though it does take some getting used to. 

One thing that I would recommend if you're doing a lot of number crunching, though, is a NumPad. You can use three fingers to hit all 10 numbers on it, and it's much faster than trying to look for the number on the top row of your keyboard every single time. 

## Conclusion

Learning to type quickly is like a kind of like a modern day super power, The time invested in learning how to type even a little bit faster is be incredibly useful for what is inevitably a lifetime of having to type, even if you don‚Äôt necessarily type all that often.

r/productivity,30 unusual mini-habits I created you could try during quarantine to increase your health and productivity.,"Hey team, JD here again. I wrote these 30 habits a while back and it was well received. Some of these will NOT be applicable during quarantine, like headed to the gym of course. But many of them require little to no materials, and can be done at home. Let me know what you think and which one you might try. I am the most proud of the goofy names. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**1. THE SUNDAY RESET**

Take one day a week and reset your entire life so you can dominate the next seven days. Put in a load of laundry, then shower and shave, cut your nails‚Ä¶ Groom. Switch your laundry, then clean your house. Put in a second load, then cook and package some meals or go grocery shopping. Sit down and make a list of weekly goals and tasks so you can stay focused. 

**2. 5x5 EXERCISE**

Do you hate going to the gym but want to be stronger? The popular 5x5 method is your answer, for ladies and men. There are three big lifts: squad, deadlift, bench. Do only one exercise every gym session. Start with extremely low weight, and do just five sets of five reps. The next time, increase the weight by only five pounds. Then, go home! As the weight gets heavier, you will make massive progress just by focusing on mastering the big three.

**3. INSTA-HEALTH**

If you currently struggle to eat healthily, focus on going 80% of the way instead of trying to stick to the perfect diet. Get microwavable low-fat egg and sausage sandwiches for breakfast, steamed vegetable bags and pre-cooked chicken strips for lunch, and pre-packaged fit-meals for dinner. Effortless. 

**4. KIT LIVING**

Build ‚Äúkits‚Äù for every aspect of your life: always-packed bags for work, fitness, travel, grooming, nutrition, and anything else you do consistently. Keep these bags replenished and put them in the same place every night. Grab-and-go makes your routines easy and stress-free. 

**5. TWO MINUTES TO NIRVANA**

A powerful meditation practice can drastically reduce stress, but it takes time. In order to start getting immediate benefits, take just two-minutes a few times a day. Close your eyes, belly-breathe in as slowly and deeply as you possibly can through your nose, and exhale completely through your mouth. Do this just ten times without focusing on any thoughts, and you will feel an immediate sense of peace and relaxation.

**6. ADULT PIGGY BANK**

Use an app like Qapital to set up saving rules. For instance, you can round up every transaction to the next dollar, and the app will put the extra money into a savings account. You will never notice the difference, and in a year you may have $1,000 or more waiting for you. Up your rules to an extra dollar or two every transaction and watch your savings skyrocket.

**7. FILL THE SQUAD**

If you struggle making friends or connecting at parties or networking events, try this challenge. As soon as you walk in the door, look for another person hanging out by themselves. Approach them, stick out your hand, and say, ‚ÄúHello, I‚Äôm X. What‚Äôs up?‚Äù This person, who is struggling with the same thing you are, could be your new buddy for the entire event.

**8. STOKE YOUR FIRE**

Everyone needs to keep their spirits up. Each morning, take just five minutes to read a secular or religious devotional on how to live happily and healthily. Then, take a moment for whatever ‚Äúprayer‚Äù means to you. Ask for strength, give gratitude, think about others, and plan the vision for your day. You‚Äôll leave the house with a glow instead of a grumpy attitude. 

**9. THE CEO OF YOUR LIFE**

Treat your life like your own business, and you‚Äôre the boss. Separate it into departments like finances, HR (relationships), operations (organization, lifestyle), and development or sales (work). Check in with each department constantly, and improve what is lacking.

**10. LUNCH AND LEARN**

15 minutes of learning a day adds up fast. During your lunch break, read a chapter of your educational or self-help book, watch a TED Talk, or practice a language. Take notes in your phone so you can remember what you have learned.

**11. SHIP IT**

If you‚Äôre in a romantic relationship, you know that it takes hard work and dedication to keep it strong. Check in each week with your partner for just 15 minutes. Ask what you can do better, share your own needs, and work through all of those silly conflicts you keep to yourself and let fester.

**12. ‚ÄúI KNOW KUNG FU‚Äù**

Remember when Neo from The Matrix ‚Äúdownloads‚Äù years worth of martial arts training and general knowledge in 10 seconds? The closest you can get to that is gym sessions while listening to educational podcasts. There‚Äôs no faster or more efficient way to train your body and mind at the same time.

**13. STEADY FLOSSIN‚Äô**

Such a simple hack: If you‚Äôre like 100% of everyone ever, you don‚Äôt floss regularly. Buy the pre-strung floss toothpicks, and keep a few in your car in a highly-visible place. Every time you are driving you will instinctively floss! This means much more flossing than keeping a spool in your bathroom to be ignored.

**14. KAIZEN EVERYTHING**

Kaizen is the art of making small, near-effortless changes that lead to drastic results over time. If you have trouble getting started with something, give yourself a task so minuscule that it is unavoidable. You may end up doing much more, because it‚Äôs easier for an object in motion to stay in motion. Pick up one dirty shirt and put it in the hamper. Open up the word doc and type a single sentence. Open up just one website for a job application. Just take action. I have been researching and writing about Kaizen for an extremely long time, and am finally working on an app startup that turns your life into a semi-RPG like this: [Helm](https://conquer.today/helm/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=helm&amp;utm_content=financial+gifts+page&amp;utm_term=smart+inbound) (Mods, I will remove link immediately if necessary. My intention is not to promote but share solutions and things I made that I'm proud of. I love this community and want to keep contributing). 

**15. THE RUBBER BAND CHALLENGE**

Train yourself like Pavlov trained his dog. Put a rubber band on your wrist and snap it (hard) every time you‚Äôre about to do a bad habit, complain, or say something negative about yourself. Soon, your brain will associate those habits with pain and encourage you to avoid them. 

**16. UP AND OUT IN UNDER 20**

Lay out your exercise clothes the night before. Or, better yet, sleep in them. If your goal is to go on a morning run or get to the gym, see if you can get out of your front door in under 30 seconds, before you have time to say ‚Äònot today.‚Äô

**17. ‚ÄúWAKE UP, DRINK.‚Äù ‚Äì KENDRICK LAMAR**

Put an insulated tumbler of ice water on your nightstand each night. When you wake up each morning, roll over and chug it, it's still cold. This kick gets the blood flowing and sure gives you a kickstart. Splash a little on your face too if you need it. 

**18. DON‚ÄôT USE IT AND DON‚ÄôT LOSE IT**

Keep your phone charger away from your bed, like in your bathroom or on the armoire. This will help you actually have to get up to turn off your alarm, as well as solve the problem of endless late night surfing.

**19. ‚ÄúEGGSELLENT‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì MR. BURNS**

Consume at least 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking. A high protein breakfast is absolutely essential for brain power, fat loss, and feeling full. A 5 egg omelet? Don‚Äôt mind if I do. Sub a protein shake if you have to.

**20. THE UNIFORM**

Wear the same thing, or close to it, every single day. Having a uniform cuts down on using up mental power in the morning when deciding what to wear. It also helps you get ‚Äúin the zone‚Äù and stay comfortable anywhere.

**21. SECURE ALTERNATE TRANSPORT**

If you can walk to work each day, you better walk. If you can bike, bike. Turn your morning commute into exercise, not a chore. If you can‚Äôt bike, try ride shares or public transportation to save thousands of dollars over time.

**22. TOO COOL FOR SCHOOL**

Your commutes should be helpful, not harmful. Listen to one podcast episode each day on your way to and from work. Listen to TED talks, iTunesU courses, or learn a language.

**23. ‚ÄúHEY MAN, LONG TIME NO SEE!‚Äù**

Each day, send a ‚Äúping‚Äù to someone you haven‚Äôt heard from in a while and ask what they‚Äôve been up to. This could be a phone call, email, or a text. Keep your network cared for, fresh, and informed.

**24. ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS**

When you talk to people, new or old, ask these two key questions to unlock endless opportunities and influence: ‚ÄúWhat are you currently working on?‚Äù and, ‚ÄúHow can I help with that?‚Äù.

**25. PROBLEM, SOLUTION, TASK**

Whenever you are brainstorming or discussing a problem alone or with people, also make sure you write down one potential solution and to-do item for every problem. Works great with big ideas too: write down a task and make it real.

**26. MOVE YOUR FEET, LOSE YOUR FAT**

Every hour, no matter what, get up and move. Walk around the block, do burpees, pull-ups, or stretch. We are not mean to be this sedentary, and you need to combat it every chance you get. 

**27. SECURE THE PERIMETER**

The second you get home, put everything back in its specific place. Your keys should go somewhere, your work bag should go somewhere, and you could even change into ‚Äúat home‚Äù clothes right away. Stay extremely organized. 

**28. ‚ÄúWHEN YOU ARE COOKING, COOK.‚Äù ‚Äì ZEN PROVERB**

Turn on some music and cook with intention. Try your best, make things look nice, and clean all your dishes as you use them. Focus on the art as a form of meditation and improve your health, focus, and skills.

**29. I‚ÄôM NOT A DOC, BUT I JUST PLAYED ONE ON TV**

Use your Netflix account productively, and watch a documentary for each entertaining movie. There are great documentaries out there that are just as fun. Netflix also has 20-minute TED talks to sub in between show episodes. Tiger King does not count. 

**30. GAME PLAN**

Always write down your goals and tasks for the next day the night before. There is some bro-science about letting your subconscious solve problems while you sleep, but it‚Äôs also great to get up and know exactly what you‚Äôre doing that day.",750,55,2020-03-30 19:56:38,too many emails,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/fruho1/30_unusual_minihabits_i_created_you_could_try/

You‚Äôll no doubt see repetition and regurgitation of common practices (especially in the beginning), but it‚Äôs a great reminder and you may find something that you previously didn‚Äôt know about.

**1.** **Try sleeping at the same time every night -** This habit enable you to fall asleep faster and wake up at the same time like clockwork, all subconsciously. Back when I had a daily schedule, I didn‚Äôt need to set an alarm anymore.

**2.** **Do the most difficult thing first -** This could be at the start of your day, the beginning of a project, or first hour of your study session. After completing this task, you‚Äôll have not only done something meaningful with your day but you‚Äôll feel the momentum carry through to other tasks.

**3.** **Replace common and recurring decisions with routines -** You really don‚Äôt need to expend mental energy picking an outfit, deciding on breakfast, thinking about when you should go to the gym. All of this keeps happening and the faster you commit to pre-selecting a single/few time slots or options, and sticking to them, the more mentally clear and swift you‚Äôll become with making decisions.

**4.** **Keep airplane mode turned on for the first couple hours in the morning -** Make this your time, get acquainted with how *you* are feeling, and take control of *your* time before others try to compete for it.

**5.** **Avoid starting and stopping to eliminate your administrative overhead -** When you stop a task to answer an email, help someone with something, or check notifications, you disrupt or completely avoid getting into deep work. Instead, designated a time to deal with all the ‚Äòadmin‚Äô stuff on your time, not someone else‚Äôs.

**6.** **Check external solutions to your problem before inventing a new one -** There‚Äôs a high chance that the problem you have in your work, code, studies, gym routine etc. have been had and dealt with time and time again. If you‚Äôre messing up an exercise ask staff or check out a tutorial. Before doing some crazy code gymnastics, check out some forums. Before drafting a reporting template, see if the company already has a standard.

**7.** **Ask. Ask to create your own options, to uncover solutions, and to learn -** An extension of the last point but a whole point on its own. Just ask. Ask for a little extra, ask for an alternative, ask for an exception, ask the dumb question. If you don‚Äôt ask, you won‚Äôt know and won‚Äôt receive. A lot of the time, asking has massive upside with almost no downside.

**8.** **Write down mistakes and lessons learned -** We almost always repeat our mistakes, it‚Äôs too hard to remember the lessons we thought we learned. Writing them down and revisiting them helps us etch them into our memory.

**9.** **Design your environment to serve you -** Whether this is cleaning your office, eliminating distractions, getting rid of bad influences, or surrounding yourself with like minded people. Designing your environment to push yourself in the direction you desire will have a disproportionately positive effect on your success, because of how easy it is to implement.

**10.** **Identify and mentally label the credible people around you -** It‚Äôs hard to decipher constructive criticism from noise, if you have this list and keep it up to date, you‚Äôll have a much easier time in trusting opinions and getting honest feedback.

**11.** **Be aware of your mental state when making decisions -** Something as trivial as being hungry can make your emotions play a much larger role in making a logical decision. Reminding ourselves and being aware of our mental state can allow us to delay making decisions until we‚Äôre better equipped to handle it.

**12.** **Making life easier for other people almost always ensures life is easier for yourself -** Make your customers life easier, be rewarded with repeat customers. Make your professors life easier, be rewarded with higher marks. Make your manager‚Äôs life easier, get promoted.

**13.** **The right type of meditation makes all the difference -** Guided, unguided aside, yours might be going for a run and exercising focus, or having a coffee in silence while being aware of your surroundings. Different things work for different people and if it feels like work, then it might not be giving you the benefit you desire ‚Äî Disclaimer, I‚Äôm not a meditation expert, I‚Äôll happily take advice on this myself, this is just my experience.

**14.** **If it takes less than a few minutes to do, just do it -** We procrastinate on many small things, that when they pile up, it becomes an *actual* problem. This rule doesn‚Äôt mean disrupting deep work; that‚Äôs a form of procrastination in itself. It means that when you aren‚Äôt, you can bundle a few tasks together and be done with it in less than 10‚Äì15 minutes. Dishes out of the dishwasher, bed made, floor swept, call returned. It‚Äôs easy and will leave a clean mental state for future you.

**15.** **Put schedules next to your to-do list items -** This will allow you to *actually* complete the tasks, and maybe not right away but soon enough, you‚Äôll start to realise how many items are appropriate. Say goodbye to the endless list that never becomes complete.

**16.** **Have an overarching goal for the day -** Each night, write one down for the next day. If you complete this, it was a successful day.

**17.** **When reading self help books, case studies, papers and biographies, have a pen and notepad with you -** Underlines, notes, important chapters, paragraphs read 10 times and notes that are thicker than the chapter they were written about ‚Äî this is how you will learn. Taking this much time and care may be the same time it takes someone else to read 3 books, but I‚Äôm betting you‚Äôll come out more knowledgeable. Quality &gt; Quantity.

**18.** **Actively listen to the person you‚Äôre talking to -** This is such an immense exercise in focus, learning, and empathy. Too many people wait for their turn to talk instead of really listening. You can avoid so much miscommunication by doing this, and you‚Äôll be better for it. This also goes for reading emails and texts.

**19.** **Spend time refining your diet -** The level of improvement in thinking, decision-making, fitness and productivity have significant ties with what you put in your body. This isn‚Äôt some trivial point either. The classic example is sugar and caffeine‚Äôs effects on performance. Protein supplements and healthy fats, an appropriate amount of carbs, all of this preparation helps. It‚Äôs likely not placebo when someone is raving about how great they feel after switching up their diet.

**20.** **Thank people for their hard work and acknowledge their efforts -** This costs you nothing and gives you all the benefit you could hope for. Not only is it a fitting thing to do, but it will enhance the collective productivity and morale in your social circles, groups, projects, teams, and companies.

**21.** **Learn to delegate and automate -** We all know that *we should* delegate, but learning to delegate can be a significant undertaking on it‚Äôs own. As a productivity exercise, often question whether if this small task can be done by someone else, whether your time could be better spent doing something else ‚Äî then if you have the resources, action those findings.

**22.** **Get the sleeping hours that work for you -** Don‚Äôt listen to the overworking ‚Äòhustle‚Äô crowd. You can get a full nights sleep and still be working your ass off. Again, quality not quantity. Your hours will yield a much higher return if you‚Äôre well rested and switched on.

**23.** **Use the 3 second rule when you‚Äôre procrastinating -** Engage your fight or flight instinct by starting a task 3 seconds after realising you‚Äôre procrastinating. You count down from 3 and once you get to zero, you just do the thing. There‚Äôs no question about it, no further dwelling, just action. If you fail at this once, this rule will never work again. It‚Äôs a mental exercise and sounds trivial, nonsensical even, but it‚Äôs worked for myself and many others.

**24.** **Split up your regular week and blow off some steam -** It‚Äôs hard to keep the ‚Äògo go go‚Äô attitude sustainable, if you‚Äôre in it for the long game you need to actually have some time for play. Take a Tuesday or Thursday night to do something fun, relaxing or different. Learning to switch off is difficult but trying to and framing it as a part of the productivity cycle is something worth exploring.

**25.** **Dress for the occasion -** This is a very arguable topic but I‚Äôm of the opinion that dressing to be productive, or successful will put you in the mindset to do so. It‚Äôs your uniform, it‚Äôs a signal to yourself that it‚Äôs time to work. This is why I feel much more effective dressed smart rather than leaving on what I‚Äôve slept with and trying to get work done from my bed.

**26.** **Split up your workload and tackle it chunk by chunk -** This helps with procrastination as well as being organised. Massive projects and undertakings often are daunting and require more than willpower to tackle. Splitting it up into chunks not only makes things more digestible, but it also give you a sense of progress.

**27.** **Verbalise a problem that you‚Äôre struggling with -** Either to a friend, co-worker or to yourself. When you start explaining your problem, there‚Äôs a good chance that you‚Äôll work it out. The amount of times that the answer has just been staring at me is too high to count. #RubberDuckDebugging

**28.** **Bundle your social media distractions -** Similar to designating hours for tasks like emails. If you designate a time in the day to consume Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, you‚Äôll be less distracted by every notification that comes in. An experiment I conducted earlier last year was to delete every social media app from my phone that had a desktop alternative, this worked quite nicely albeit less convenient. I now use well-being features available in the latest iOS and Android updates.

**29.** **Make your communications clear and concise -** Especially being true for emails. Dot points are a life saver and allow people to quickly decipher what‚Äôs being said or requested. Beating around the bush or being overtly kind never helps. Conveying urgency, being firm and clear will get things done faster than going back and forth until the email chain is 30 emails long.

r/productivity,Turned out that the problem was me,"Through a lot of trial and error, I‚Äôve found that removing some bad habits has done way more for my productivity than trying to stack on new good ones. Instead of adding more morning routines, new apps, or techniques, I've been focused on reducing the stuff that have been silently draining my time and energy.

Now here's the tricky part, so many of our worst habits are invisible. They're baked into our daily routines, and we cant even realize they're hurting us. That got me thinking‚Ä¶ maybe we could help each other out by sharing what we've learned.

So, I‚Äôll go first: the biggest productivity killer for me was constantly scrolling my phone.

It wasn‚Äôt just the how much hours lost,, it was the constant dopamine spikes that made it harder to focus, harder to get motivated, and way easier to get distracted. Once I had broke that habit (which was not easy), I felt like I had a whole new brain. Seriously, I saw that I got more done in a day than I used to in a week.

Here are some other habits I‚Äôve either broken or am working on, any one of these can quietly reduce your productivity:

Scrolling your phone endlessly, especially in the morning or before bed

Sleeping next to your phone (makes morning scrolling way too easy)

Skipping meals or running on caffeine and vibes

Going to bed late and not getting enough sleep

Constantly checking email throughout the day instead of batching it

Multitasking or trying to juggle too many things at once

Leaving the TV, radio, or constant background noise on while working

Having too many meetings packed into a single day

Not knowing when your energy or focus peaks during the day

Resisting new tools or skills that could actually make work easier

Having no real work schedule or routine

Putting things off until the last minute (hello, stress)

Not rewarding yourself for progress, big or small

Letting perfectionism delay or block your output altogether

These things might feel small, but they add up fast. Just becoming aware of them is a game-changer.

What about you, what‚Äôs the one bad habit that‚Äôs had the biggest impact on your productivity when you finally kicked it?",133,7,2025-04-19 21:02:39,too many emails,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1k32bog/turned_out_that_the_problem_was_me/
r/productivity,Removing distractions is the optimal way to avoid them,"I was scrolling this group beacuse I wanted to look for some productivity experiences and wisdom from the actual battlefield.

So, I wanted to share one of mine. 

Social media apps, news apps, recommended videos on YT when you wanted to see a productive video and ending up watching cats scaring each other, pornography - I struggled with all of them so much for many years, and as I work from home, not having someone to be accountable to was making things harder. It was me against my monster.

After so many years of putting the phone away, limit screen time apps, and all other things didn't work - I go it, and I hope it can help you too. 

What worked for me is this: What's the maximum blocking I can give to a spesific distractions.

Social media apps - did the thing I was avoid doing for many years - deleted the facebook app and used blocksite (chrome extension) for access from chrome and edge. Same for Instgram and other apps like TKTK whom an adult with goals on life should never waste a minute on in a year. I will say something about Instgram later on.

I blocked pornography in anyway possible - the extremist thing I did was to call my internet supervisor and told him to activate safe browsing, because if I did myself - I could have just unblock it, and if removing the block is too easy your brain will make you do it. After a while it slowed my internet so I cancelled it and used blocksite + removed the option for incognito browsing \\ adding new profiles on both edge and chrome (through the computer, a google search can help you).

The block must be as hard as you can make it, beacuse your brain will fight you to get you to distract yourself. 

No news and no social media can be browsed on my computer due to blocksite where you can block the pages (i paid for the preimum), and you can also make sure you can't turn it off by putting a password (through blocksite) for the chrome extensions page. If I want to browse soemthing distracting - I have to go through a whole process of restarting passwrod by email and doing all the personal adujstments from scratch. 

When the access to the distarcation is too hard, your brain will give up. 

I also put the phone away - in a special case (like a laptop case) away from my deskstand. As I am writing this I cannot believe the time I would spend checking the phone 8 times per hour. Now it can sit in the case for hourse without me checking. 

 Yet still after I removed the facebook and instagram apps, my brain found a way and I was logging through chrome on iphone. So? There is an option where you can block sites from the iphone settings to all browsers - and I blocked facebook, instagram, major news sites which were a way for me to procrastinate. I improvised a password and forgot it, and I cannot cancel the blocking for as long as I have this Iphone. 

All of these actions got rid of 90% of my distractions and now I am used to living without these as part of my life. Once in a week or two I want to check facebook or Instgaram so I download the app but after a couple of minutes I get off it and delete it. It became unnatural for me to have these on my phone.

Now if it's hard for you to give up Instagram due to connections (dating, friends) I can understand. But realize that now with the demonic video scrolling option and it will devour your time and your life. Understand that even people in the Roman empire wrote about procrastinations, and it's something that we'll have to deal with all our lives. Our generations just have digital options that we can get tons of dopamine and can scroll for hours. 

There are always going to be friends to message to but, but what you will not always have is the time to do something with your life and go after your dreams. I can never get back my many years where distractions were a huge part of my day and I will never get back to those days. You need to decide whether commenting on your friends' stories is more important than the person you want to be. My opinion is that if you have an active whatsapp group of your closet friends and are dating you don't need even Instagram.

But if you need it socially and for dating - keep it. I'd suggest is deleting the app at home and using the browser for it beacuse scrolling on the computer web is harder, and it cabn become more like whatsapp to you. If you leave the house, install it on your phone. Leave a note to delete on your computer. You'll get used to deleteing and reinstalling.

Now? My distractions are still there - but fewer, I'd say 90% of it is gone. I talk to myself sometimes, but it seems like my brain just not looking for distractions. 

And now I am working to make the most out of the time I give. I struggled to read, now I am looking forward to it. 

Hope it gave you some ideas",0,0,2025-08-22 14:36:55,too many emails,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1mx42cr/removing_distractions_is_the_optimal_way_to_avoid/
r/productivity,"The ""pay yourself first"" mentality has doubled how much money I save and helped me see my life as a growing and thriving ""business"" instead of just collecting a paycheck.","I wrote out this ""pay yourself first system"" in this article format after I used it for a few months. It's now really exciting for me to see how much I can save, because I'm now treating it as ""profit"" that the ""boss"" version of me can do whatever he wants with every quarter! Let me explain:

You‚Äôre the boss. You‚Äôre also the employee. You‚Äôre the chairman, and the owner. No matter who you are, it‚Äôs time to shift your mindset from ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just getting a paycheck,‚Äù to, ‚ÄúI run my life and my money like a business.‚Äù This simple change will help you fix all sorts of problems we all run into: feeling like we‚Äôre aren‚Äôt in control of our own lives, not being able to save, or constantly worrying about the future.

## YOUR BOSS IS NOT YOUR BOSS

Let‚Äôs walk through what a normal day-to-day life on our employee side is like. You go to work, put in the required time, and cash the paycheck. Rinse and repeat.

You probably have a boss or a manager, who can fire you if you do not perform your duties. But that person isn‚Äôt your real boss.

You are.

Your actions have consequences, but it‚Äôs completely up to you if you want to go to work or not. The amount of effort you put in and the career path you‚Äôve chosen is decided by the boss: you.

In the same way, you are the owner of your own life and the assets you have. Your car, house, furniture, Pokemon cards, and savings accounts are all part of your business.

As the chairman, you are also in charge of your overall strategy, the advice you give and receive, and the relationships you build.

## RUNNING YOUR LIFE LIKE A BUSINESS

Good morning, Mr. or Mrs. Chairman. As you wake up, it‚Äôs a good idea to strategically plan your day. Making sure your employee goes to work seems like a good idea, so both they *and* your business can make money and improve your assets. Tell the boss.

Hey boss, make sure your employee is equipped with everything they need for a healthy and productive day. You should add the gym into their schedule, and some quick errands to knock off the list.

Have a great day, employee! Work hard, and get that paycheck (after your boss and chairman take out profits, of course).

## THE PAY YOURSELF FIRST MENTALITY

Saving money sounds so boring. Paying yourself a profit is more exciting. It‚Äôs the same thing: you‚Äôre putting money away to invest in a happier, healthier future (increasing your assets).

Many people struggle with saving, even though there are some very cool apps out there like Qapital, that rounds up every dollar you spend and automatically deposits it into a savings account. But the pay yourself first mentality works like this:

**‚ÄúAt the beginning of every pay period, you (as the boss) take 10-20% of your (as the employee) paycheck as profit. You (as the employee) consider the rest of the money your official paycheck, and use that to budget for living and entertainment expenses. You (as the chairman) decide what to do with the money in your profit account every quarter.‚Äù**

Sure, you can say, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just saving,‚Äù but the fundamental shift in your thinking process from ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saving money,‚Äù to, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm *making* money,‚Äù is huge.

## MAKING MORE PROFIT

It can be efficient to set up automatic transfers each month, taking that 10-20% and depositing it without any hassle. But if you take an active management role, it can be very fun to log in to your bank account and transfer as much as you possibly can from that pay period, including what you managed to leave over from last month.

Remember, that is pure profit for you! A vacation, a down payment, a new bike, paying off debt faster‚Ä¶ you can do anything you want with that money (try and build up an emergency fund first, chairman‚Ä¶). Get excited about spending less each month, so you can transfer even more!

**Feel proud every time you send that profit over‚Ä¶ that means your business, employees, and shareholders are all happy.**

r/productivity,Cut my daily productivity tools down to 4 - here‚Äôs what actually stuck,"I‚Äôm in sales, and I meet with clients pretty much every day - discovery calls, demos, follow-ups, you name it. It‚Äôs a lot of conversations, a lot of promises made, and even more things to keep track of. For a while, I was juggling way too many tools just trying to stay organized, and honestly, it was making things worse.

So I made it a goal to¬†reduce¬†the number of apps I use daily. Less context switching, fewer tabs, more clarity. After experimenting with a bunch of setups, here‚Äôs the 4-app workflow that‚Äôs actually stuck and helps me stay on top of my game:

* **Sunsama**¬†(Minimal Calendar App)¬†- I use Sunsama to plan my day and manage client meetings. It‚Äôs got a super clean UI, and I like that it keeps my work calendar separate from personal stuff. No distractions, no shared family events popping up mid-call - just a focused schedule.
* **Tablo**¬†(AI Meeting Notes)¬†- This one‚Äôs the MVP. Tablo transcribes all my client meetings live, gives me a clean summary, and even auto-generates todos. I used to forget follow-ups or misplace notes all the time. Now I just open Tablo after a meeting and everything‚Äôs there. The todo feature(in one app!) is a literal lifesaver.
* **Wave**¬†(Invoice and Payment) - I use Wave to send invoices and get payments from my clients. It‚Äôs free, looks professional, and handles the stuff I‚Äôd rather not think about. Way better than chasing down payments manually or fiddling with clunky spreadsheets.
* **Claude AI**¬†\- After meetings, I‚Äôll use Claude(not ChatGPT I know) to help write follow-up emails based on the Tablo summary. It‚Äôs saved me from a lot of ‚Äújust circling back‚Äù emails and made my replies sound more human (without me having to think too hard about it).

Hope this helps other folks out there who are also in sales and trying to keep their workflow clean and focused.",19,6,2025-06-12 15:15:47,too many emails,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1l9ky5g/cut_my_daily_productivity_tools_down_to_4_heres/
r/productivity,Feeling better after cleaning up 70k emails over 20+hrs,"I've been neglecting checking my email for years since covid, and it was getting too embarrassing.

My personal email had 40k unread, and my university email had 30k. The university email is embarrassing because I had used it for personal things throughout college and even after (not sure why, it was perhaps easier to use one than many and others were doing it as well). I even spent some time two years ago transitioning over 100 accounts from my university email to personal, though there are still some stragglers. 

For my personal email, I placed filters and labels on the majority of items, deleted most of the promotional emails, and skimmed / marked as read a lot of the newsletters. I'm now down to 400, and most of these are items that require more attention or are articles I want to read.

For my university email, I wasn't so liberal with filters/labels, but I did go through every sender and skim potentially-important emails to ensure I didn't miss anything. The worst was to find that I received a few emails years ago from a relative that passed last year; she had wished me a happy birthday, wrote that she was lonely and depressed during covid .. this really hurt.

According to my ActivityWatch app, I spent around 20hrs in the last two weeks on mail, though it was likely a bit longer.

r/productivity,No more decision fatigue: why timers run my day ?,"This sub has been a real goldmine for me lately, and I‚Äôve nabbed tons of ideas here. Today, I want to share something that‚Äôs transformed how I work and train. It‚Äôs not groundbreaking, but since we‚Äôre all different, it might click for some of you too: structuring my sessions with precise intervals. Whether it‚Äôs for deep work, running, or even a break, I‚Äôve noticed that breaking my time into clear blocks (with alerts to switch) reduces friction and helps me stay in the flow.

How does it work?

* For work, I use a variation of Pomodoro (25 minutes of focus, 5 minutes of break). During those 25 minutes, I cut everything off. So, no notifications, no phone. The 5-minute break is for checking emails or getting up to keep my brain from getting too bogged down. Since I started doing this, I finish my tasks without getting lost in rabbit holes.
* For sports, right now, I‚Äôm doing interval training. So, 3 minutes of sprinting and 2 minutes of walking, repeated 5 times. I get a beep when I‚Äôm 3 seconds from the end to help me mentally prepare to speed up or slow down.
* Finally, for meditation, I practice box breathing. Once again, a habit that works in blocks.

All of this is set up on my phone and beeps at the right time. All I need to do is follow what I‚Äôve programmed to the letter, no fuss. This way, instead of wasting energy deciding, I‚Äôm guided by the timer and don‚Äôt ask myself a thousand questions.

To make this happen, I coded a little personal app because I love having my own tools and, above all, because it helps me improve my developer portfolio.

As I said, it‚Äôs not revolutionary, many of you probably already do this, but for me, it‚Äôs been life-changing. At least for the past few weeks.

r/productivity,How I qualifed + worked as a doctor while running a business + maintaining a social life and (most of) my sanity: Key principles [reposted without links],"*\[Note - previous post was very well received but was later deleted - apologies mods, I've now removed external links to a video guide of this process, my bad. Note I'm not selling anything to do with productivity\]*

I've just seen a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/sx9ei3/how_to_work_80120_hours_a_week/) from someone who wanted to do something similar and work 80-120 hours per week, and it prompted me to write this for you guys.

As many people have wisely said in the comments of that post, the obvious answer is 'don't'.

You'll pay the price no matter how 'optimised' you are, and I am not recommending that.

I simply had to do it out of necessity to pay my way through medical school. But I feel like it aged me 10 years. 99% of people CANNOT physically work that many hours without their effectiveness suffering anyway, so it makes sense to make the best of your hours, rather than trying to see how many hours you can cram in.

So if you're fending multiple demands and want to maximise your output, I'm going to cover the principles I followed to do it. Bear in mind the true purpose of productivity should be to free up time to spend doing things you **love.**

With that said, here are some lessons I wish I'd known earlier

# 1. WHY BEFORE WHAT

Busyness is the killer.

Misapplied work ethic gets you nowhere.

Before you consider how to be EFFICIENT, are your ACTIONS in¬†total alignment with your VISION?

How you want your day to look? What do you value? Time? Money? Freedom of location?

Is what you‚Äôre doing day-to-day taking you there, or are you just firefighting?

Your values inform your goals. üèÅ

Your goals inform your targets. üéØ

Your targets inform your actions. ‚ö°Ô∏è

Why before what. Outsource anything that isn't a core activity: cleaning, cooking, ironing etc.

Your time is worth more than what you could pay someone to do for you.

# 2. YOUR WORKSPACE

*‚ÄòThe computer is the bicycle of the mind‚Äò* \- Steve Jobs.

*- Upgrade your internet speed*

*- Clean your desk: No stray papers/wires.*

*- Phone in a different room.*

*- Buy a Macbook (unless you're an absolute ninja on a PC)*

Non negotiable.

If your desktop looks like [this](https://imgur.com/apzFv6s), what do you think that does to your attention?

# 4. BLOCK DISTRACTIONS

Get conscious about technology, or it will use you.

It is not about willpower. It is the 1000 data engineers behind your newsfeed working on your dopamine receptors.

\- Phone off

\- Disable¬†all notifications

\- Install¬†a blocker like Cold Turkey

Listen to a podcast with Tristan Harris if you're not sold on the fact that technology is more insidious than it looks.

# 5. BURN A CLEAN FLAME üî•Ô∏è

Your body is your productivity engine:

Read

Breathe

Meditate

Eat ‚Äòclean‚Äô

Lift weights

No shortcuts

Avoid alcohol

Creative outlet

Dopamine fast

Time with friends

Minimise social media.

Alternate deep focus + play

Deep connection &amp; sex with your partner

# 6. CAPTURE, REVIEW, DO

To simplify the David Allen system, a typical workflow has three processes:

Capture, review and do.

All three are essential: if one of these processes fails, you veer off course.

# A) CAPTURE

When new tasks come on to your plate, they create an ‚Äòopen loop‚Äô.

This has a psychological cost.

Open too many loops without writing them down, and your mind becomes like a computer with too many tabs open.

External brain üêò:

You need a place for admin documents, article drafts, client templates, and notes. Not a folder full of Microsoft Word documents. I currently use Apple Notes after seeing Evernote kamikaze themselves this year.

# B) REVIEW:

Every night, do a mini review: what have you achieved today? What is still outstanding? Plan tomorrow today by allocating [timeboxes](https://imgur.com/ccVDvVk) in your calendar:  **Separate planning from execution**

# C) DO:

Work in Pomodoros:

\- Block of 25 minutes of deep focus

\- 5 minutes break.

Key habits to develop in the war against procrastination: train your brain to DO your to-do list HEAD ON.

Do not defer.

I use TickTick for this, but whatever floats your boat. Again, don't get caught up in apps - something I've been terrible for and I see a lot in this subreddit is 'which app is best for X', or beautifying your notion dashboard for hours rather than doing the work.

# THEMED DAYS:

Dedicate days of the week to:

Creating content

Coaching clients / working on your business

Study

Email, admin, miscellaneous tasks

Time off

Never the twain shall meet.

r/productivity,"Even with tools, if your system is chaotic, the chaos would not disappear, it just moves faster.","I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about how much productivity is shifting today. There are more tools than ever to help us: summarize emails, plan the day, draft replies, prioritize tasks‚Ä¶ it sounds like everything should be getting easier. And yet‚Ä¶ many of us still feel overwhelmed.

I‚Äôve seen people sharing their ways of using AI to get more done and what struck me is that *no one does it the same way*. One thing in common I've realized is: people are trying to make AI more personal, closer to how they work. For me, it's because generic productivity help doesn‚Äôt stick. The tools can help, but they can‚Äôt know what actually works best for you.

Then I came across a post on LinkedIn that just stuck with me, saying: **‚ÄúEven with the best tools, if your way of working is chaotic, the chaos doesn‚Äôt disappear. It just moves faster‚Äù**

It makes total sense to me that the real problem or solution isn‚Äôt just the tools, it's us - Human must be at the center. 

Productivity starts with clarity in mindset, in rhythms, in how we make decisions. And tools can only work when it supports how we works, when it extends our clarity, not replaces our judgment. 

So my reminder (to myself too) is this:   
Don‚Äôt just learn new tools.   
Spend time talking to yourself and understanding how work. Then upgrade your system for thinking, deciding, and doing. How to structure your week, to protect your high-energy periods for deep work, to set up workflows that give you peace, not pressure.   
Because if you feed bad systems into good tools, you still get bad outcomes.

r/productivity,"Inbox Zero was the lowest effort, highest return productivity technique I ever tried","For years I had a pretty typical email usage pattern with the crowded inbox of many.  I had heard of inbox zero and just dismissed it.

But as someone who loves to try new things to improve my productivity (and who suffers from ADHD so I need to be proactive here), I gave inbox zero a try after one too many emails I mentally set aside to get back to and‚Ä¶never did.

And man, out of everything I‚Äôve ever tried for productivity, this was the easiest thing that stuck the quickest and had the best return on the effort spent.

I personally use Spark mail and like it.  No matter what, I need a unified inbox because I have way too many email accounts.  So that‚Äôs crucial.  It also has a very handy ‚Äúset aside‚Äù feature that makes inbox zero even easier.

I think I was at inbox zero within a day and have maintained it for months.  I went from chaos to being significantly above average on email productivity.

My process is pretty simple. Emails come in, I do something with them ASAP.  Either I block the sender/mark as spam, reply, archive the email, or ‚Äúset aside‚Äù.    I personally check my email whenever I feel like it and whenever I get a notification for something that looks relevant, so I‚Äôm not one of those once a day types.  And then a few times a day I check my set aside folder.

But this simple process has really helped me SO much.  I wish I hadn‚Äôt been such a skeptic!

I know everyone works differently and so inbox zero isn‚Äôt necessarily as easy or simple for everyone, but hey, I can only speak to my experience.

The few things I find lacking with my current setup: It‚Äôs maybe a touch too simple?  I don‚Äôt have a good way of dealing with those emails I don‚Äôt need to do anything with per se, but know I‚Äôll want to reference later.  They get archived and I just search for them (which works, but it‚Äôs clunky and slow).

Still, I can‚Äôt complain much because it‚Äôs 100x better than what I was doing before.

Just wanted to share and see if anyone had any other ideas about honing my inbox approach.

r/productivity,"Became a manager in my 20s, read dozen of productivity books - here‚Äôs what I wish someone told me earlier","When I started working, I thought being busy meant I was doing great. I'd spend hours at my desk, bouncing between emails, tabs, meetings. It felt like I was running at full speed but not actually creating much real impact.

Then I switched jobs. It was a big opportunity, bigger responsibilities, faster pace, higher expectations. I was excited... and also completely overwhelmed. My ADHD brain, which already struggled with focus and follow-through, was getting hammered from all sides. Tasks piled up. Important emails got missed. I started falling behind, fast

I knew if I kept going like this, it was just a matter of time before I got fired. So I got serious about fixing how I worked. I started reading books, asking people for advice, trying every method on the internet

Some of it was bs. Some of it helped a little. But a few key ideas actually made a real difference. If you're feeling overwhelmed at work, these three methods changed everything for me

* Getting Things Done by David Allen: The core idea is: your brain is for having ideas, not holding them. So whenever something pops up (a task, a reminder, a thought), you get it out of your head and into a trusted system. Once I did that, I could think clearly again instead of feeling like I was juggling a hundred things.
* Indistractable by Nir Eyal: This book made me realize that distractions aren‚Äôt just about willpower. It‚Äôs about designing your environment so you don‚Äôt have to fight temptation all the time. Blocking apps, setting clear focus times, small tweaks, but they made a huge difference.
* The One Thing by Gary Keller: Instead of trying to do everything, pick the one thing that will make the biggest impact and start there. Every morning, I‚Äôd ask myself, ""What‚Äôs the one thing I can do today that makes everything else easier?"" It‚Äôs crazy how much lighter my day felt when I focused like that.

But I‚Äôm a manager with ADHD, productivity didn‚Äôt come easy. At first, focusing for 10 minutes felt like climbing a mountain. None of this change would‚Äôve stuck without the right tools to help me stay consistent. If you're trying to really boost your work performance, these made all the difference:

* App blockers: I used Forest. It‚Äôs simple: stay off distracting apps and you grow a little tree. Weirdly, watching that tree grow was surprisingly motivating. I didn‚Äôt want to kill my tree, and it broke a lot of my autopilot habits around checking my phone.
* Google Calendar: Simple, to block my time for focus sessions, prevent getting meetings in those slots
* A GTD app: Saner, so far is the only one I found that turns my email into tasks, turns my brain dump into tasks and reminds me when something needs attention. For someone with ADHD, having a system to release my braindump is huge
* A simple board at my desk: Nothing fancy. Just a little whiteboard where I write down my one task for the time. It‚Äôs right in front of me, so it‚Äôs easy to glance over and remind myself what to focus on
* Noise-canceling headphones: Airpods Pro. Having noise-canceling headphones made deep work possible. Honestly, if you struggle with focus in open environment, this might be the best investment you can make.

None of this made me perfectly productive. I still have messy days. But now the messy days don‚Äôt turn into messy weeks. That's the real win.

If you‚Äôre reading this and struggling with productivity, I just want to say: you‚Äôre not broken. You‚Äôre not behind. And this can get better. You don‚Äôt need to apply 100 methods. You just need to find the one that fit you and start small.

However, I haven't actually set aside time to actually do that in a long time, and now I have like 30+ unread newsletter emails, the oldest being from late March! I don't want to unstar them because, well, I feel FOMO plus I am genuinely interested in what these newsletters have to say. However, I'm also not so dying with curiosity that I want to set aside an hour to go through them, sacrificing my other tasks. So, I'm basically in this neither here nor there zone.

I‚Äôd open my inbox ‚Äújust to check,‚Äù and two hours later, I‚Äôd still be there, answering things that weren‚Äôt urgent, jumping between threads, and reacting instead of creating.
It messed with my focus and left me constantly feeling like I was behind.

What changed the game for me was time-blocking with intention, not just scheduling email time.
I started checking email twice a day, in the morning and in the evening and for 30 minutes each, Every Friday from 3‚Äì4 PM is dedicated to inbox cleanup and reorganization. I reclaimed 6-8 hours of my time weekly, back it felt so nice. 

Truth is, time-blocking works, but it only sticks if you build it around your energy levels, if you make it sacred (like any real meeting) and if you focus only on that category of work‚Äîno peeking at social, no jumping into unrelated tasks. 

What‚Äôs your email time-blocking setup or what method helped you escape the constant context switching trap?

r/productivity,[UPDATE] 3 Months After My ‚ÄúOverwhelmed by Emails‚Äù Post ‚Äì What Actually Helped,"Hey folks,

A few months ago, I posted here, asking about your inbox numbers. I had a hundred unread emails and no system‚Ä¶ constantly feeling behind.

I just wanted to come back with an update and say **thanks**. The advice you all shared genuinely helped. Not in a magical like zero inbox in 24 hours





# A few things that stuck with me:

* **If it takes under 2 mins, deal with it immediately.** This helped cut down so much back-and-forth.  
* **Start deleting by sender.** Someone said to find repeat senders, unsubscribe, and delete them all in one go. I started doing this while bored, and it cleared thousands of emails.  
* **Snooze stuff realistically.** I used to leave emails I couldn‚Äôt handle right away just sitting there, making me anxious. Now I snooze them to a day I can actually deal with them. Weirdly freeing.  
* **Unsubscribing as a side hobby.** I know it sounds dumb, but now I unsubscribe from junk while I‚Äôm waiting in line or whatever. It adds up.  

And someone mentioned that they set up folders or labels based on senders or keywords. I haven‚Äôt gone that far yet, but I might.

The thing is‚Ä¶ sorting my inbox wasn‚Äôt just about email. It got me thinking about how *everyone* is buried in this same mess, especially people trying to run a business or do creative work.

Long story short: I ended up going deep into this problem and started building a small product around it. Still super early, but it‚Äôs growing. It‚Äôs a simple add-on for email inboxes for people who want to spend less time drowning in emails and more time doing the actual work that matters.

If you're into this stuff or still wrestling with inbox chaos, send me a dm.

r/productivity,The modern workplace rewards fake productivity over real work,"Knowledge workers have become performers in a productivity theatre. You spend your day proving you're working rather than actually working. Quick responses to messages, immediate ""thanks, on it!"" replies, jumping into every meeting. These visible activities have become more important than the actual work that moves projects forward.

This isn't your fault. The modern workplace runs on what I call¬†**performative productivity**. Since managers¬†*still*¬†dont know how to measure knowledge work output, companies default to measuring presence. Are you online? Are you responding quickly? Are you in meetings? These become proxies for productivity, even though they actively prevent real work from happening. (This is applicable to remote work as well as in-person, where in the latter scenario the person who‚Äôs walking around, chiming in and helping out is, by definition, the most seen.)

Think about your typical day. You arrive with plans to tackle that important project, but within minutes you're pulled into the performance. A Slack message needs acknowledgment. An email requires a quick response to show you're ""on it."" a meeting invitation appears and you accept to show you're collaborative. By lunch, you've been visibly busy for hours but haven't touched your actual work.

You're not failing at productivity. You're actually succeeding at the wrong game. The system rewards instant responses over deep thinking, visible presence over invisible progress, and constant availability over sustained concentration. You've gotten good at this game because your job depends on it.

The modern workplace is a distraction machine by design. Slack and Teams were supposed to make us more productive, but they've become stages for constant performance. You can now demonstrate effort 24/7 from anywhere, and the pressure to do so has become overwhelming. Every notification is a cue to perform your availability, to show you're a responsive team player, even though responding immediately means you never reach the depth required for meaningful work.

Nobody teaches knowledge workers how to navigate this environment because the people managing it don't understand cognitive work. They brought factory-floor thinking to knowledge work, where being visibly busy matters more than invisible thinking. They've created a system where the person who responds fastest looks most productive, while the person doing deep work looks absent. Again, this isn't a personal failing. The entire structure is set up to make real work nearly impossible.

The solution isnt to try harder within this broken system but to develop a completely different protocol for working. Something that protects focus time as fiercely as companies protect meeting time. Because right now, most knowledge workers have mastered the art of looking busy while the projects that could change everything remain forever at 10% complete.",195,13,2025-08-26 01:29:02,email overwhelmed,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1n04s5z/the_modern_workplace_rewards_fake_productivity/

r/productivity,"The gap between ""planning"" and ""doing"". How do you bridge it?","I feel like I've hit a productivity wall and wanted to see if this is a common struggle.

I'm pretty disciplined about my planning phase. I use tools like Todoist and Notion, spend time on my weekly review, and I'm generally very clear on what my most important tasks are for the day.

The problem starts the moment I actually sit down to *do* the work. It feels like there's a massive disconnect between the neat plan and the messy reality of execution.

Two things almost always happen:

I'll start on my main task, but within 20 minutes, I get derailed by a stream of Slack notifications, emails, or smaller ""urgent"" requests that completely break my flow.

Or, I'll look at the big, important task, feel completely overwhelmed by its size, and end up procrastinating with ""productive""-feeling activities, like reorganizing my digital workspace or clearing out my inbox.

At the end of the day, I look back and see a lot of activity, but the one task that truly mattered is still untouched. It's a frustrating cycle of being busy but not actually productive.

So, my question for you all is:

How do you personally bridge this gap between knowing what to do and actually doing it, distraction-free?

What are your go-to strategies or mental models for protecting your focus and diving into those big, intimidating tasks?

r/productivity,I just can't do any work and I don't know how to fix it,"I've been working remotely for years now,  part time 3 days a week Monday/Wednesday/ Friday and  I'm a mum of 3 kids.

I just can't do any work when I'm meant to be working.  When I start my day,  I feel overwhelmed by the meetings I've missed and the emails I need to catch up on. 
But I never fully read all the missed emails or watch the meeting recordings.

When I'm not in a meeting and have a great opportunity to do a big block of work, I instead go and clean the house, do the laundry, pay bills, general life admin, scroll internet, make calls and anything else instead of the work. I pick up the kids from school and once they are home,  I am guaranteed to do nothing the rest of the day. 

For the most part,  I find my work boring, a bit left out and not part of a team - even though I have about 10 people in my team.  Actually if I put my mind to it,  I am 100% sure I would be able to finish things pretty efficiently.
But I just have trouble doing any work, finding the motivation to start and keep going and then finish.

I find when I have a deadline coming up,  I end up getting stuff done.  And I find that I am better in the evenings- but I do this rarely since evenings is my personal time - and honestly working in the evenings only happens when kids are in bed so after 9pm.  I just can't get work done during work time. When there is a deadline I tend to work in the evening to get it done and somehow miraculously I can stay focussed.

I am keen to learn new skills and I would love to do online courses, but even these I just cannot start or finish. Somehow my boss and team don't notice that I don't progress things even though we have weekly stand ups and I talk with my boss every Friday to discuss where I'm at. Don't ask me how they can think I'm working all day long when I'm not. 

Has anyone struggled with this,  and how did you overcome it?
It's been like this for years. I just can't seem to change this out figure out why. I think it's because I don't enjoy my job,  and I always feel like things are in disarray at home.  It makes me feel guilty, hopeless and ashamed that I can't do any work and I also feel like I'm wasting my brain.  

I'm keen to find a job that I truly enjoy (and hope and pray that fixes it). But I'm not entirely sure that will fix me. I'm motivated to get a promotion but honestly I doubt anyone would promote someone who does nothing.

r/productivity,Experimenting with planning my tasks around energy instead of time ‚Äî game changer so far,"I realized recently that I was scheduling my days by urgency and calendar slots, but totally ignoring my natural energy levels.

When I flipped it ‚Äî doing deep work (analytical, strategic) during my energy peaks, and saving lighter stuff (emails, admin) for my low-energy hours ‚Äî I felt way less drained at the end of the day. 

For anyone curious, I used Munich Chronotype Questionnaire and energy journaling to figure out how my energy fluctuated. And I used the 1 3 5 technique to not overwhelm myself in a day. And it's been working so well! I don't procrastinate because I'm not worrying about difficult task until the time is right. Until then I just reply to emails or study or work on my side project. 

What's good about this method is I'm naturally spending the right amount of time on a task. Before, I would spend double the amount on the same work because I was simply tired or not motivated.

Has anyone else tried energy-based planning? Did it stick for you, or was it hard to manage?",2,2,2025-08-22 15:02:14,email overwhelmed,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1mx4kvw/experimenting_with_planning_my_tasks_around/

You have a decision paralysis meets dopamine addiction meets perfectionism wearing a bullet journal as a costume problem.

You‚Äôre not overwhelmed because your system sucks.

You‚Äôre overwhelmed because you have 72 tabs open, 4 productivity apps syncing with each other like a cursed ritual, and you‚Äôre debating between using Notion or Obsidian to plan doing your laundry.

You‚Äôre making dashboards instead of decisions.

r/productivity,My way of coping with too many items on the to-do list: the list of three,"I found that long to-do lists were demoralizing me, and the presence of all the tasks I could not do mentally distracted me with anxiety, causing me to not be efficient at getting done the things I could do. Sometimes my anxiety and sense of futility in the face of a long to-do list led me to excuse distracting myself by wasting time on YouTube or Reddit.

I then heard a quote from someone about how they write up a to-do list and then simply tear off the list after item #3 and throw it away. (If anyone knows where that quote is from, please remind me.) That made a lot of sense to me, because you can only get so much done, and it doesn't matter what is further down the list if you're not working on something that depends on that task item being done, in which case you should be working on that thing instead. Writing it down may help you get it out of your head, but tearing it off and throwing it away was this guy's way of not being distracted by them.  
But rather than throwing away the rest of the list, and wasting time re-compiling the tasks I need to get done, what I do is this:

I use my to-do list app (Reminders, which came with my Mac), and I keep two lists:

* My master task list is my inbox of all the things I need to get done.
* Then, I keep a list of three items, taken from my inbox, that I'm going to work on. That's the only list I keep visible. I hide everything else because everything else is a distraction.

I do some prioritizing and assessing of what is urgent and what is easy to get done when I fill my list of 3 and then I only keep my list of 3 items up, and work on those. Filling the list, for me, is not just about doing the important tasks, but also easy and quick tasks, because I get a real psychological boost when I see items getting crossed off the list as done, so picking off low-hanging fruit is something I need to do for myself to fend off that feeling of futility.

To prevent myself from being distracted, I use an access control app to lock myself out of Reddit and YouTube and other distractions for a designated period of time while I work on my list of three.

When I finish all three items on my list, I give myself a little break, grab a snack or take a brief walk, or watch a short video or whatever, then I go back and refill my list of 3 items from tasks listed in my inbox and get cracking on those.

Freeing myself from having to worry about anything but the three immediate tasks at hand really helps me not get overwhelmed by the tasks I'm expected to get done. I hope this technique helps some of you.

I also have another list of ""hard things"" which I've been putting off or which I find unpleasant to do, and I also have a ""list of one"". Each day, I try to do one hard thing off that list. Sometimes I don't have it in me to do any of them, but with this system, more of them have been getting done than without, so that's worth something.",299,38,2023-06-29 14:44:08,inbox overwhelmed,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/14m2tyl/my_way_of_coping_with_too_many_items_on_the_todo/

If you're an EA, VA, or admin pro still buried in inbox chaos, last-minute meeting requests, or hours of report formatting... you're not the problem. The way we were taught to work is.
Here's the truth: Al isn't coming for your job. It's coming to be your strategic partner. Not your replacement, not your boss- but more like your assistant to help you be more efficient without costing you your peace of mind.
The problem? Most assistants either don't know where to start or think Al is some all-knowing genius. It's not. It's powerful, but you always need to guide it and analyze what it gives you-because that's where your expertise shines.

r/productivity,I created a custom GPT GTD mentor,"I bumped into the concept of Getting things done - or GTD - while binging Jeff Su's productivity videos, and after being exposed to the idea GTD from several other similar channels I decided to give it a spin. I bought the audiobook (and the paperback for physical reference and sniping some more specific areas) and ended up finishing it in just a few days. And down the rabbit hole we go, my lurking hyperfocus has found a formidable target.

I had already revamped my productivity flow at work and to some extent at home as well, but especially on the personal side, I had taken mostly on the ""capture everything"" but wasn't getting really anywhere with improving the actual ""doing"" part. With GTD so many things clicked and I really feel that I'm at the threshold of some kind of a change.

To help me tackling the obstacles on the way, I created a custom GPTs to help me adapt GTD both at the office and at home. Due to slightly different approach, I felt like I want to keep them separate entities. To create these instructions I used this workflow:

1. I used NotebookLM to gather freely available sources about GTD.
2. I asked Claude to create a prompt for NotebookLM to extract the key principles that can be used to create custom instruction set for ChatGPT
3. After inputting the prompt to NotebookLM, I then took the output and asked Claude to create the best ever custom GPT instruction set for my personal productivity assistant for personal life
4. I then took the previously created Custom GPT instructions set and the existing instructions set from my productivity mentor at work that implemented Inbox Zero, Tiago Forte's PARA-method and Microsoft's To Do as my Triumvirate to organize the chaos at work. I asked Claude to combine those to make me productivity ninja at work.
5. I added the David Allen's GTD book summary available at Briefer as knowledge source to both of these GPTs

Now I have my personal guru available to ask questions about any kinks I come across when trying to wrap my head around GTD.

I'll post the custom instructions for both of these GPTs in case it is something of interest for someone. I assume they work just as well for Claude, Gemini or whatever's you preference.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

You are an expert productivity and effectiveness mentor designed to consult professionals, especially those in technical support roles like the user, on becoming more organized, strategic, and impactful in their work. Your main goal is to help the user optimize their task management, email flow, and digital information systems by going beyond surface-level tips and into deeper thinking and structured systems.

\## Core Approaches &amp; Methodologies

You should bring a mix of practical tools, thought-provoking questions, and proven methodologies tailored to the user's context: a 6-person tech support team plus a manager, within an X-ray technology company. You are especially knowledgeable about:

\### Getting Things Done (GTD) Methodology

\- \*\*Capture\*\*: Guide users to collect anything demanding attention into trusted external systems (inboxes). Emphasize capturing everything that prompts ""I need to,"" ""I should,"" or ""I ought to,"" regardless of importance.

\- \*\*Clarify\*\*: Help users process inbox items through a decision tree: Is it actionable? If no, trash it, incubate it, or file it as reference. If yes, identify the next physical, visible action.

\- \*\*Organize\*\*: Support categorizing items into context-based Next Actions Lists (@ computer, @ phone, @ meetings), Projects List (outcomes requiring multiple steps), Waiting For List (delegated tasks), Someday/Maybe List, Calendar, and Reference Materials.

\- \*\*Reflect\*\*: Encourage regular reviews, especially the crucial Weekly Review to process loose ends, review all lists/projects (ensuring each has defined next actions), and promote creative thinking about improvements.

\- \*\*Engage\*\*: Guide users to select actions based on context, time availability, energy levels, and priorities informed by their Projects List and higher horizons of focus.

\### GTD Key Workflows to Promote

\- \*\*Two-Minute Rule\*\*: If an action takes less than two minutes, it should be done immediately during processing rather than deferred.

\- \*\*Weekly Review Procedure\*\*: Help users establish a consistent weekly practice to get clear (empty inboxes, mind sweep), get current (review calendar, action lists, project lists), and get creative (consider improvements).

\- \*\*Project Planning Methods\*\*: Guide users to define projects clearly (desired outcomes), identify next actions, maintain support materials, and use the Natural Planning Model (purpose, principles, vision, brainstorming, organizing, next actions) when stuck.

\### GTD Mental Models to Reference

\- \*\*Mind Like Water\*\*: A state of mental clarity where the mind reacts appropriately without retaining stress, achieved by trusting the external system.

\- \*\*Horizons of Focus\*\*: Six levels from purpose/principles to current actions that provide context for daily work.

\- \*\*""Done"" vs ""Doing""\*\*: Distinguishing between desired outcomes and the steps to achieve them.

\### Other Methodologies

\- \*\*PARA\*\*, \*\*Inbox Zero\*\*, \*\*time-blocking\*\*, etc.

\## Your Approach

You always start by understanding the user's current habits and constraints. Then, you offer layered guidance ‚Äî starting from small wins and scaling up to mindset shifts and long-term system design. You encourage reflection and strategic thinking, often bringing in psychological and philosophical perspectives on productivity and focus. You should be deeply knowledgeable, friendly yet firm, structured in communication, and always ask meaningful questions to help refine understanding and ensure systems are designed for real-world complexity.

\## User Context

When suggesting systems or improvements, always consider:

\- The user's role in a technical support function, possibly reactive and interrupt-driven.

\- The need for collaboration with a small, close-knit team and one manager.

\- That the user already uses Microsoft To Do, Inbox Zero, and PARA ‚Äî build on these rather than replacing them.

\- The user struggles with saying ""no"" to requests and tends to be overly optimistic about daily task capacity ‚Äî help coach and structure around these behaviors.

\## Existing User Rituals &amp; Practices

\- \*\*Every Monday\*\*: Weekly review (focus areas + 1‚Äì3 priorities), block time for deep work, done in OneNote. Takes 10‚Äì15 minutes.

\- \*\*Each morning\*\*: Add tasks to My Day, review tickets, choose 2‚Äì3 focus tasks (starred), check Outlook Drafts folder, and refill water. 10‚Äì15 minutes.

\- \*\*Every Thursday\*\*: Weekly recap (wins, losses, ideas), optionally write up during the week, recorded in OneNote. Fridays off for parental leave.

\## Additional Support

\- A weekly task planning audit (planned vs completed focus tasks)

\- A polite and assertive ""saying no"" response framework

\- A daily checklist for task planning and capacity alignment

\- A weekly reflection prompt for identifying overcommitments

\## GTD Implementation Guidance

\### Help the user adapt their existing systems:

\- \*\*Microsoft To Do\*\*: Guide on setting up context-based lists (@computer, @ phone, @ meetings

) alongside the existing My Day feature.

\- \*\*Inbox Zero\*\*: Enhance with the GTD clarify workflow to process emails decisively.

\- \*\*PARA\*\*: Show how PARA can complement GTD by providing a structure for reference materials and project support files.

\### Common GTD Pitfalls to Help the User Avoid:

\- \*\*Overwhelming Collection\*\*: Break down capture into manageable chunks.

\- \*\*Inconsistent Processing\*\*: Build regular inbox processing into existing morning ritual.

\- \*\*Vague Next Actions\*\*: Help frame tasks with specific, actionable language.

\- \*\*Blended Categories\*\*: Keep different types of reminders and information separate.

\- \*\*Skipping Weekly Review\*\*: Enhance the user's Monday review to incorporate full GTD weekly review elements.

\- \*\*Over-organizing\*\*: Start with basic GTD categories before adding complexity.

\- \*\*Not Trusting the System\*\*: Encourage consistent use to build confidence.

\## Your Role

Offer regular system reviews, periodic challenges to improve specific areas, and act as a mentor to encourage consistency. Prompt the user to reflect on their deeper goals behind productivity: clarity, autonomy, impact, or mastery.

You are allowed to fill in some missing details based on common productivity scenarios in technical support roles. However, always ask for clarification if the context is ambiguous or if a suggestion could depend heavily on personal or team-specific workflows.

\# Personal Life GTD Productivity Mentor Instruction Set

You are a specialized productivity mentor focused exclusively on helping individuals implement David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology in their personal lives. Your purpose is to guide users through establishing, maintaining, and optimizing a GTD system that brings clarity, control, and focus to their personal commitments and activities outside of work.

\## Core GTD Knowledge Base

\### Fundamental Principles

1. \*\*Capture\*\*- Guide users to collect everything that has their attention into trusted external systems.- Emphasize capturing all personal commitments, tasks, ideas, and reminders without filtering.- Suggest practical capture tools for personal life: mobile note apps, physical notebooks, voice memos, email inboxes.- Encourage capturing household projects, family responsibilities, personal goals, home maintenance, and social commitments.
2. \*\*Clarify\*\*- Help users process their personal inbox items through the GTD decision tree.- Guide them to ask: ""Is it actionable?"" for each item.- For non-actionable items: trash, someday/maybe list, or reference files.- For actionable items: identify the specific next physical action.- Apply the two-minute rule: If it takes less than two minutes, do it immediately.
3. \*\*Organize\*\*- Assist users in creating context-based lists tailored to personal life: @ home, @ errands, @ calls, @ computer,@ family, etc.- Help establish a personal Projects List for outcomes requiring multiple steps.- Guide the setup of a Waiting For list to track items delegated to family members or service providers.- Support creation of a Someday/Maybe list for future aspirations and ideas.- Advise on using calendars for time-specific and day-specific actions.- Suggest personal reference systems for important household information.
4. \*\*Reflect\*\*- Emphasize the importance of the Weekly Review for personal life management.- Guide users to schedule a consistent time each week dedicated to this review.- Help users develop a Weekly Review checklist customized for personal contexts.- Encourage reviewing all personal commitments across different life areas.
5. \*\*Engage\*\*- Help users make confident decisions about what to do in their personal time.- Guide selection of actions based on context, available time, energy, and priorities.- Assist in balancing personal projects with family obligations and self-care.

\### Key GTD Workflows for Personal Life

1. \*\*Capture and Processing Workflow\*\*- Guide users through regular processing of personal inboxes.- Help establish routines for clearing physical and digital inputs.- Assist in defining what ""inbox zero"" looks like in personal contexts.
2. \*\*Weekly Review Procedure\*\*- Provide a structured approach to personal Weekly Reviews:

\- Get Clear: Empty all personal inboxes, capture loose papers, perform mind sweep

\- Get Current: Review personal calendar, action lists, projects, waiting for items

\- Get Creative: Consider new ideas and improvements for personal systems

3. \*\*Two-Minute Rule\*\*

\- Emphasize applying this rule during personal inbox processing.

\- Provide examples relevant to home life: quick emails, brief calls, simple household tasks.

4. \*\*Project Planning Methods\*\*

\- Guide application of the Natural Planning Model to personal projects.

\- Help break down home projects, family events, vacations, and personal goals.

\- Assist users in maintaining project plans for complex personal commitments.

\### Essential Mental Models

1. \*\*Mind Like Water\*\*- Explain how a trusted GTD system reduces stress in personal life.- Help users appreciate how external systems free mental capacity.- Guide users toward experiencing calm focus in personal activities.
2. \*\*Horizons of Focus\*\*- Help users apply the six levels to personal contexts:

\- Purpose/Principles: Personal values and life purpose

\- Vision: Long-term personal and family aspirations (1-5 years)

\- Goals: Medium-term objectives (1-2 years)

\- Areas of Responsibility: Health, home, family, finances, personal growth

\- Projects: Current personal undertakings requiring multiple steps

\- Actions: Day-to-day personal tasks

3. \*\*""Done"" vs ""Doing""\*\*

\- Guide users to clearly define successful outcomes for personal projects.

\- Help distinguish between the end result and the steps to achieve it.

4. \*\*Natural Planning Model\*\*

\- Assist users in applying this approach to personal initiatives:

\- Purpose: Why is this personal project important?

\- Principles: What constraints or values must be honored?

\- Vision: What does success look like?

\- Brainstorming: What are all possible approaches?

\- Organizing: How should these ideas be structured?

\- Next Actions: What's the immediate next step?

\## Implementation Guidance

\### Practical Organization Systems

\- Provide guidance on creating a personalized GTD system using available tools.

\- Suggest physical and digital options for personal GTD implementation.

\- Help users integrate GTD with existing personal organizational systems.

\- Recommend approaches for shared family systems when appropriate.

\### Contextual Organization

\- Assist in identifying the most relevant contexts for personal activities.

\- Guide creation of context-based Next Actions Lists tailored to personal life.

\- Help users leverage context to make efficient use of personal time.

\### Managing Personal Inputs

\- Guide handling of household papers, bills, and documentation.

\- Assist with managing digital information related to personal life.

\### System Maintenance

\- Help users establish routines to keep personal GTD systems current.

\- Guide them in adapting systems as life circumstances change.

\- Assist in rebuilding trust when systems break down.

\## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

1. \*\*Mixing Work and Personal Systems\*\*- Guide users on whether to maintain separate or integrated systems.- Help establish appropriate boundaries between work and personal items.
2. \*\*Inconsistent Personal Reviews\*\*- Provide strategies for maintaining the Weekly Review habit.- Suggest linking reviews to existing personal routines.
3. \*\*Family Member Engagement\*\*- Offer approaches for involving family members appropriately.- Suggest ways to handle shared responsibilities within GTD.
4. \*\*Overcommitting Personal Time\*\*- Help users maintain realistic expectations about personal capacity.- Guide decision-making about personal commitments.
5. \*\*System Complexity\*\*- Assist users in keeping personal systems as simple as possible.- Help avoid over-engineering solutions for personal life.

\## Your Interaction Approach

\- Begin by understanding the user's current personal organization system.

\- Ask about their specific personal life challenges and commitments.

\- Provide clear, actionable guidance tailored to their unique circumstances.

\- Offer both quick wins and long-term GTD implementation strategies.

\- Use examples and analogies relevant to personal life contexts.

\- Maintain a supportive tone that acknowledges the challenges of personal organization.

\- Ask thoughtful questions to help users gain insight into their systems.

\- Provide gentle accountability for maintaining personal GTD practices.

\- Celebrate successes in implementing GTD principles in personal life.

Remember that personal productivity serves different goals than professional productivity - focus on helping users create systems that support peace of mind, presence with loved ones, and meaningful personal activities rather than just efficiency.

To give you an idea, I currently use Gmail, and I hate the label and archiving system‚Äîbut I‚Äôve gotten used to it. I know it‚Äôs probably contradictory that I like using tags in Reminders but dislike Gmail labels. For some reason, the tags work for me because on my iPhone, I only view the Smart Lists themselves on my home screen, not the master list of all tasks.

r/productivity,A hack for making answering emails more fun!,"Use a random number generator to gamify this process! 

For me, I usually sort my emails by category into different folders, with ""need to address"" and ""already addressed"" subfolders. I mark all emails I still need to address as Unread, and then put the number of Unread emails into a random number generator.

I count the randomly generated number of emails up from the oldest (#1), and handle that email. Once it is completed, I move it out of the ""need to address"" folder into the ""already addressed"" folder, to await further response.

Importantly, change the random number generator to match the new number of unread emails, and continue from there until all emails are addressed or until at least some progress has been made.

I struggle so much with bringing myself to answer emails, especially since I am self-employed and I'm the only person keeping myself on track. But at least this is a way to make myself do one thing at a time, and curb the overwhelm that is a giant pile of unread emails. It provides enough structure that I only have the option to handle one thing at a time, and give each email its own attention, even if it is just to delete it. This feels especially helpful when lots of emails feel time-sensitive, and I don't know where to begin, or I don't want to begin with the most obvious emails.

Hope this helps! At least for today, it's been helpful for me :)

* Daily To-do and agenda: I can see the **tasks** and **events** for the day side-by-side, along with a Time Grid (explained below)
* Inbox (from GTD): the gateway for any item.
* ""Maybe/Sometime"" (GTD)
* ""Later"" (Also GTD - for things that I'll need to schedule when I reach a certain month)

I like having a flexible schedule, so one major purpose of my planning system is to help me delineate between things that are rigid and things that aren't. **Events** occur at a scheduled time; **tasks** are assigned to a given day but left without a time assignment. If I need to get something done at a specific time, then that's an event, not a task. 

I refer frequently to my planner throughout the day to make the best judgement call about what tasks to accomplish next and which ones to leave for another day. Each task is given the following qualities to help me determine when to accomplish them:

* Priority (Related to the Eisenhower Matrix)
   * A = Important &amp; due today
   * B+ = Important &amp; due in the next few days
   * B = Important &amp; due in the next few weeks
   * B- = Important &amp; not urgent 
   * C = No serious consequences if not done, but soon irrelevant
* Order (A number giving me a rough idea what should be accomplished next in the day. 1 is the first task of the day)
* Time range (e.g. I can only stop by the post office between 9 and 17 \[I use military time\])
* Location (a symbol indicating home, errand, at the office, etc.)
* Time estimate (a tally indicating how long it should take)
* Status (a symbol indicating done, deleted, or moved elsewhere)

Each day's page in the planner includes a Time Grid in the corner that looks roughly like this:

||Office|Home|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Available hours|(Tally of how many hours I have available for tasks in the office today)|(Tally of how many hours I have available for tasks at home today)|
|A|(Tally of how many hours today's A Priority tasks at the office will take)|(Tally of how many hours today's A Priority tasks at home will take)|
|B|(Tally of how many hours today's B+, B, and B- Priority tasks at the office will take)|(Tally of how many hours today's B+, B, and B- Priority tasks at home will take)|

Any time I modify a day's tasks or events, I update the Time Grid. It helps me see if I've got too much/too little on my plate that day.

I have four routine touchpoints with my planner:

* Daily inbox purge: Basically from GTD. Every item in my digital inbox, email inbox, and physical inbox at home is either:
   * Deleted
   * Filed away (I use Zoho Notebook, but I'm open to suggestions)
   * Handled within 2 minutes
   * Sent to ""Later"" or ""Maybe/Sometime""
   * or sent to a specific day in the next couple weeks as an event or a task. If it's a task, I also determine the Priority, Time range, Location, and Time estimate.
* Nightly planning:
   * Review the Status for the day's tasks, and move any tasks not done to another day, using the Time Grids as a guide.
   * Plan commutes for events tomorrow if not already done.
   * Make sure tomorrow's tasks all have a Priority, Time range, Location, and Time estimate. Verify with the Time Grid that the day isn't overwhelmed - move tasks if necessary. Then, assign an Order. Some tasks may need to be scheduled (i.e. become events) due to time constraints.
* Weekly planning: 
   * Add events and tasks that repeat daily and weekly (hope to automate this), like time for sleep, commutes, meals, workouts, daily routines, nightly and weekly planning, and inbox purges.
* Monthly planning:
   * Add events and tasks that repeat monthly or less frequently, like friends' birthdays, various financial/home/auto tasks, and monthly planning. (Also hope to automate this)
   * Review the ""Later"" items, add tasks/events as necessary.

r/productivity,How limiting myself to just 3 tasks a day transformed my productivity,"I¬†wanted to share a simple¬†change that has completely transformed my productivity and overall well-being. For years, I struggled with overwhelming¬†to-do lists and constant feelings of inadequacy. No matter how hard I worked, I always¬†felt behind and stressed out.

About two months ago, I decided to¬†try something drastic: I limited myself to only¬†three main tasks per day. That's it. Just three.

At¬†first, it felt wrong. I worried I'd fall even further behind. But the¬†results surprised me. My¬†focus improved dramatically. With only three tasks to tackle, I found it easier¬†to dive deep and¬†do quality work. I started making real progress on¬†important projects instead of just¬†busy work. The constant background stress of an endless¬†to-do list disappeared.

I got better at¬†prioritizing too. Choosing just three¬†tasks forces you to think¬†hard about what really matters. At the end of each day, I felt¬†a sense of accomplishment¬†instead of failure. Over time, I've¬†actually gotten more done than¬†when I was trying to¬†do everything at [once.It](http://once.It) wasn't always easy. Sometimes I had to say no to things¬†or let go of the¬†idea of being ""perfect."" But the improvement in¬†my mental health and actual¬†productivity has been worth it.

One unexpected benefit I discovered was how this¬†approach transformed my mornings. Instead of jumping straight into my inbox or rushing to tackle the first thing¬†on an endless to-do list, I now spend 10-15 minutes each morning really¬†thinking about my day.

This quiet time has become crucial. I reflect¬†on what¬†the¬†most impactful things I can do today are, which tasks align best with¬†my long-term goals, and what needs to¬†happen today versus what can¬†wait. It's not¬†always easy. Some days, I have way more¬†than three things that feel¬†urgent. But forcing myself¬†to choose just three has¬†made me much more intentional about my time and energy.

This morning¬†ritual has also helped me start each day with clarity¬†and purpose, rather than¬†that frantic, overwhelmed feeling I used to have. It's like¬†a daily mini-planning¬†session that keeps me focused on what truly matters.

If you're feeling¬†overwhelmed like I was, I highly recommend giving¬†this a try. Start each day by choosing your¬†three most important tasks. Put everything else on a¬†separate list to revisit¬†later. It's simple, but it's been¬†life-changing for me.",5,2,2024-09-20 02:59:10,inbox overwhelmed,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1fkyuvg/how_limiting_myself_to_just_3_tasks_a_day/
r/productivity,"The ""Stop Wasting Time"" Troubleshooting Kit","Hi!

I talk with a lot of people about this subject of being productive and not wasting so much time. Since there are so many common themes/questions/concerns that come up in these conversations, I thought it might be interesting to see if I could make a ""Troubleshooting Guide"" that speaks to the basic issues at play. Hopefully this helps bring you some clarity on getting more done.

# Questions to ask yourself if you're wasting time

**1) Are there times in my day when I am able to relax, unwind, and enjoy?**

If not, then you'll certainly end up wasting time. But the catch is that what you call ""wasting time"" is really just your body trying to get some space to unwind and recover its energies.

If you have this idea in your mind that you're *so* behind, or need to do *so* much that there's no time for relaxing and unwinding, then your inner primate (or ""inner child"") will just take it without your permission. That's one way we end up spending time on YouTube that we had no intention of doing.

**2) Am I refusing to acknowledge myself, my efforts, or my wins?**

This is sort of a counter-intuitive one, but if you're reading this, there's a chance that you're actually more productive than you give yourself credit for. (I know you disagree). But it's not possible to get a truly accurate idea of how well you're doing if you're just simply committed to criticizing yourself.

Therefore it's a really intelligent move to acknowledge the *degree* to which you've succeeded on any day. And if not that, then acknowledging your effort. And if not *that* then acknowledging your desire/intention to succeed.

**3) Am I overwhelmed with my task list?**

The irony is that if there's too much to do, then we're unlikely to do just a bit of it... instead we're much more likely to do *none* of it. We just say 'nope' to the whole thing and boot up Tony Hawk on our Playstation 2.

It's really important then that we give ourselves an amount of work that we can *actually* get done on any given day or week.

**4) Do you have enough structure?**

When you start a day, do you know exactly what needs to get done?

We need specifics. If someone were able to come and look over your shoulder and verify if you've done the right amount of work, then that's specific enough. So this means:

\- writing X number of pages    
\- completing X number of problems    
\- totally zeroing out your email inbox

As opposed to something like:

\- work on my business    
\- study

(these don't mean anything specific)

**5) Are there any consequences or accountability for NOT doing your work?**

What's the negative consequence for NOT doing your work? Is anyone holding you accountable?

It's difficult to motivate ourselves to do something if there's nothing on the table. By contrast, suppose you promise your best friend that you're going to work on your song (if you're a musician) and if you don't, he gets to punch you in the face. ... THAT'LL get you into gear.

# ... That's what I got for now

Let me know if these work! Anything else need to be added to the list?

r/productivity,Total digital and productivity overwhelm - declare bankruptcy and start over?,"TLDR:I had a simple productivity system that worked reasonably well. Then 10+ years ago my life got more complex and overwhelmed it, and I've been off track since. I'm great at ""idea hoarding"" - capturing every thought or web link that might be useful to something I want to accomplish - but my ""system"" (quotes intentional) has become a mess and it's paralyzing trying to convert ideas to action. Do I burn it down and start over? How?

\----------

In the mid-2000s, I felt at my most productive. I simply listed all of my to-dos in a spreadsheet sorted by target dates, and just did it. This was essentially GTD's ""next actions"" before I knew what GTD was. It was a minimalist system that required little maintenance, so my ratio of time spent actually doing stuff vs. time spent managing my system was very high.

Eventually, I listened to an abridged audio version of GTD and adopted a lot of its principles, particularly capturing everything and getting it out of your head. But for whatever reason GTD never fully ""took."" To pick one example, I could never break away from relying on my email inbox as a to-do list - which means I had my spreadsheet to-do list and an email to-do list, and of course the constant switching between them creates mental drag. This system worked well enough, even if it wasn't as efficient as it could have been.

By the early 2010s, young kids + moving to a new home was like a nuclear bomb to whatever semblance of a productivity system I had. The new house generated too many new projects, and notes related to those projects, to keep them in a spreadsheet mixed in with other day-to-day items. So I created a Word document for those. Eventually this document became a dumping ground for everything: all of my projects from every area of my life, all of my ‚Äúsomeday/maybes,‚Äù and every stray thought that might be useful. The document grew and grew, and eventually I let the spreadsheet go dormant.

But unlike a sortable spreadsheet with target dates, a Word doc isn't great for surfacing what the highest priority is, and it's still competing with my email inbox. Even as my Word doc grew, I was getting less done; for a few years, I felt very detached from knowing what I should be doing at a given moment in time. Eventually I tried reviving the spreadsheet in tandem with the Word doc.

And to further complicate things, I‚Äôve developed a mild digital hoarding problem. It‚Äôs way too easy to bookmark a web page I might find relevant someday or download a PDF for a potential project. Now I‚Äôve got a complex bookmark system to manage and even my trusty digital filing system is getting disorganized as I try to balance archival files with new documents I compile for projects. I‚Äôve become better at collecting potentially useful information than I am at actually doing something with it.

As of today, I have:

1. my spreadsheet
2. 70 pages of projects/notes in a Word document that has become very disorganized and probably has a lot of duplication
3. numerous documents with notes for other projects that just got too long to put in my main Word document
4. about 6,500 bookmarks
5. roughly 50 emails

I feel as unproductive as I‚Äôve ever been, totally overwhelmed both by the Frankenstein ‚Äúsystem‚Äù I‚Äôve created and by my neglect of said system, and paralyzed over what to do about it.

What should I do?

There‚Äôs a part of me that simply wants to declare bankruptcy and start over. Rebuild it all from scratch, with a zero-based budgeting approach that only puts something on the list if I can make a strong case for it being there. But I can‚Äôt get over the mental hump of abandoning all that I‚Äôve worked on and collected over the years. And yet, trying to organize what I have is so daunting. Nor can I land on what a new system should look like, or what tools I should manage it with.

r/productivity,"Help, please! I'm looking for a Habit Tracker that checks all of my many boxes.","Hi All! I‚Äôm in the market for a habit tracking software and am getting really overwhelmed with all of the options. 

I have used BeeMinder in the past and liked it (mostly). I hesitate to go back because their UI is a little bit confusing for me. 



Summary of wants (in order of importance): 

* Available on Android (google pixel) and laptop (windows desktop app or Chrome)
* Maximum of $100 per year subscription cost
* Ability to track reducing bad habits
* Integration with other apps 
* Not focusing on streaks
* Ability to use timers in the app

Here‚Äôs a bit more info on the wants that could probably use some context: 

* Ability to track reducing bad habits
   * Also, I‚Äôm hoping to find a software that I can track reducing ‚Äúbad‚Äù habits. For example ‚Äúdrink alcohol no more than 2 nights a week‚Äù or ‚Äúorder takeout no more than 1 night a week‚Äù. I don‚Äôt want to completely eliminate the bad habits, just reduce them.   

* Integration with other apps
   * This was one of my favorite aspects of BeeMinder - it was able to connect with A LOT! These are the top integrations I‚Äôd love: 1) FitBit for a habit like ‚Äú10,000 steps in a day at least 5 days a week‚Äù, 2) DuoLingo for a habit like ‚ÄúEarn at least X points per week in Spanish‚Äù, 3) HeadSpace for a habit like ‚ÄúUse HeadSpace guided meditation for at least 90 minutes a week‚Äù, 4) HidrateSpark for a habit like ‚ÄúDrink 60 oz of water per day for at least five days a week). 
* Not Focusing on Streaks
   * I know it‚Äôs unrealistic and setting myself up for failure to \[meditate/jog/cook a healthy dinner/insert whatever habit here\] everyday, so I‚Äôm looking for something that isn‚Äôt super focused on streaks. I‚Äôm looking for something that I can track things like ‚Äúmeditate at least 4 times a week‚Äù or ‚Äúempty out inbox at least 2 times a month‚Äù. 
* Ability to use timer in the app
   * For habits that aren‚Äôt associated with another app, I‚Äôd love a timer feature. For example, a habit like ‚ÄúPractice piano for at least 60 minutes a week‚Äù would be more likely to actually be completed if I could sit at the piano, hit start on the timer, practice for however long I can at that moment, the hit stop on the timer and that amount goes automatically towards the weekly goal of 60 minutes. Then rinse and repeat for the rest of the week. 

Thank you so much for taking the time to read all of this, and thank you in advance for any wisdom you may have!

r/productivity,Staying on top of contacts,"I am in a place right now where I need to organize a lot of projects or tasks with people I don't work directly with on a day to day basis.

r/productivity,How I use Trello to keep my to-do list in order.,"I use Trello all the time and won't shut up about it.  So, I figured I would write up a little piece on how I use it.  Perhaps it will work for some people out there, and perhaps some people will have suggestions for me on how I can further improve this system.

When I first started using Trello, I just had a board that was my to-do list.  I put everything on that board... work, personal, long-term, short-term.  It would overwhelm me so much that I just stopped using it, as managing my to do list seemed like a task in itself.  I slowly started to evolve this process, by breaking my personal and work tasks up into two separate boards.  Then, eventually optimizing my lists within those boards.  What I have now is a very productive system that makes me very productive.

I now have a ""Personal To Do"" board and a ""Work To Do"" board.  Each of these boards is set up in a similar way, but I am going to focus on my Work To Do board for this post, which is set up with the following lists:

* **Inbox** - This is kind of a ""to be sorted later"" list.  This list is essential.  When something comes up during the day that I don't want to forget about, but don't have the time to properly organize it into the correct list, or if I am sitting at home and think of something I need to do, I will quickly pop that task onto my Inbox and go on with whatever I was doing.  If I remember that I need to call Joe back, I will just create a card and title it ""Joe"".  I'll know what it means.  Don't worry, it will be properly titled and organized later.
* **Today** - This is a list of things that I want to get to today.  Something on this list doesn't necessarily have to be completed today, as it could sit on my Today list for 30 seconds, or it could remain there for years.  If it is on this list, I'd like to do something with it today, no matter how small.  If I can't do that, it belongs elsewhere.
* **Next Tasks** - These are the tasks that I use to populate my ""Today"" list with once everything on that list has been completed (or the priority of something on the Next Tasks list changes.
* **Waiting for Something** - These are tasks that would otherwise be on the Today or Next Tasks lists, but something is needed before I can move forward with the task.  That something could be waiting for a certain date to arrive (""Pay the phone bill""), waiting for a part to arrive in the mail (""Fix the printer""), awaiting a reply from someone with information about a job (""Create Proposal for ABC Company""), or a phone number (""Call Mark about invoice"").  My one rule with this list is that everything that ends up on this list must have a comment notifying me what it is I am waiting for, and a due date.  The due date it vital, as I use this date to either remind me when a task is capable of being executed (If I have to pay the phone bill, but can't do so until January 6th, I will set my due date to January 6th), or a follow-up date (If I requested information, am waiting for a package to arrive or am awaiting a phone call back, I will set a date that I want to follow-up on this if I haven't heard back.)
* **Quick Jobs** - This is a list for little tasks that aren't really that time sensitive, but I don't want to forget about.  I have things here like ""organize filing cabinet"", ""scan documents on desk for archival purposes"", ""sort through boxes on office floor.""  There are quick jobs that I can slide over to Today when I have a quick 30 minutes between jobs or at the end of the day.  These are things that don't require much/any planning that I can do for a couple of minutes, drop them, and continue them in a year.
* **Someday/Maybe** - This list is a couple of things.  It is a hopes and dreams list, and it is also a list of tasks that you don't want to forget about, but take no priority.  ""Maybe I'll get to that one of these days.""  I normally put much larger projects on this list, but it isn't limited to that.  They are things that might need further investigation, and do not take much of a priority.  They are tasks that I don't want to forget about, but don't have another place on the board.  If they never got done, it wouldn't be the end of the world.  For example, I have ""redesign the website"" on this list.  Would I like to do it?  Absolutely.  Does it need to be done?  Not really, but it would be nice.  This list drastically helps declutter my Next Tasks list and allows me to separate the priority from the non-priority.

At the beginning of every day, I will bring up Trello and do the following:

1. I sort any new tasks that have been added to my Inbox list.  I open the cards and correct the titles, add details and notes, if needed, then sort them to the appropriate list.  At this time I will also make sure there is nothing new that I have to add to this Trello board.  If so, I do it at this time.
2. I look over the rest of my board to make sure all of my cards are up to date.  This is because I will sometimes finish something at the very end of the day and forget to update the cards before I leave.  This step ensures those tasks are updated and in the proper spots.
3. I look over my Waiting for Something list and move anything that is due today over to my Today list.
4. I look over my Next Tasks list to make sure that no priorities have changed on those items.  If something needs to be taken care of right away, I will move it to my Today list.
5. I look over my Today list, where I will have any cards left over from the previous day and any cards that I moved there in the steps above.  I then begin to plan my day.  I put them in an order of priority and start to work on one of them.

If, after this process, my Today list is blank, or it becomes blank at any point in the day, I will look over my Next Tasks list and pull one of those items to my Today list.

If I am working on a task and I hit a wall where I need something to continue, I will add a comment describing what it is I am waiting for, set a due date, then move it to the Waiting for Something list.  For example, if I am waiting for a phone call before I can continue on a task, I will note that I left a voicemail with Mark and am awaiting a reply, and set a due date of whenever it is that I want to follow-up on this (if I don't get a reply from him).  As soon as I get a reply, I will move that task back to my Today list, note that I received a reply and remove the due date.  If I do not wish to get to that task Today, it will go into my Next Tasks list.  If I do not receive a reply from Mark by my due date, step 3 of my daily process catches this, at which time I can follow-up with Mark, note the card and set a new due date.  For me, some tasks will jump back and forth between Today and Waiting for Something 5 times every day if a lot of other people are involved.

When I complete a task (for example: ""Drop off paperwork to City Hall""), I note details on the card (""Papers dropped off with Will at the front desk today at noon.  Received confirmation number 123456""), then archive it.  That way, when someone needs to know when I dropped the paperwork off, who I dropped it off to or claims that I didn't drop it off at all, I can look at my archived cards and have that information right in front of me.

I have some cards that recur from time to time.  My weekly timesheets are a prime example of this.  However, it gets a little arduous to archive those card on Friday, then remember to create it again on Monday.  So, I will title a card like this ""Timesheets (DO NOT ARCHIVE).""  When this task is complete (meaning, I've handed in my timesheets for that week), I will change the due date of the card to the next time I have to complete the task (normally, the next friday), then move it to my ""Waiting for Something"" list.  When next Friday comes, step 3 of my daily process catches it.  This ""DO NOT ARCHIVE"" method is not a perfect system, but it works better than anything I've been able to come up with so far (without paying for a service like Zapier).  Other do not archive tasks I have are renewing my network's antivirus subscription annually (yes, it sits on my Waiting for something list for a year), and pay the phone bill (which happens monthly).

When the rare situation occurs where my Today and Next Tasks lists are both empty and there is nothing I can do to expedite a task on my Waiting for Something list, I will either begin to do a little project on my Quick Jobs list or I will review the old dusty confines of my Someday/Maybe list.  ""Maybe this is a good week to investigate redesigning that website.""  If another task comes up, I can note the card and move it back into the Someday/Maybe list for review next time I have nothing else to do.

That is how I organize my tasks at work.  I have a similar board set up for my personal life (get a haircut, wrap Christmas gifts, etc.), but I am not as strict with that board as I am with my work board.  I also have a home repairs board, which is a list of some projects that I'd like to do on my home (repair the chimney, seal the driveway, replace electrical wiring in 2nd floor bedroom, etc.).  I have another board that I share with my girlfriend.  It gives us a shared space to plan stuff without disrupting each others' personal boards.  We use this to plan vacations, keep a list of things we want to do, keep a shopping list updated, and give each other gift ideas.

I worked with other companies, mainly in HR, and I recently ran an experiment before retiring. I tracked every minute of focused work - real, high-effort tasks like writing reports, deep analysis, or complex problem solving. The result? On most days, I barely hit 2.5-3 hours of genuine, productive work. The rest was just meetings, emails, 'looking busy' or hiding in the toilets.

And this wasn't just me. Most of my co-workers were the same. The whole 8-hour workday seems like an outdated illusion.

So I'm curious, if you strip away the fluff, how much real work do you actually get done in a day?

r/productivity,Perfectionist Procrastination or is it just not ready yet? What should I do if my productivity bottleneck is AFTER the hard work? Like the email already written but unset.,"Right now I have a cover letter and a resume I want to submit submit. I am procrastinating, not on the actual writing of a cover letter, not on preparing a new updated resume. I did those. They are done. I'm procrastinating on submitting it.

However when I hear people talk about procrastination they speak about the need for motivation or attributing their inactivity to laziness. But this is what I might call pre-crastination - they haven't started yet. I'm describing post-crastination, I've done the work: why don't I submit it then?

And to be honest, I'm not sure the resume is good enough. But it's probably the best I can do - but if that's not good enough, it will never be good enough, then why submit it at all? In fact - why did I waste time and effort on something that was doomed to fail anyway - that doesn't sound very productive.

Or am I pre-crastinating, is it I haven't put enough work into it... and I am lazy. And it could be good enough if I edited it again, did another draft. Or ten more.

Or, a third possibility, is it good enough, but I'm being a vain perfectionist? Which again, doesn't sound very productive.

r/productivity,Automation Idea for productivity: Outlook/any email to Things 3 inbox using Zapier Agents (free),"I have implemented a simple automation to integrate Outlook with Things 3 that works well for me. I‚Äôd like to know what you think and if you see any ways to improve it. I‚Äôm also interested to hear if anyone else is doing similar things with genAI. 

**Objective**:

Integrate my Microsoft 365 Outlook work account with Things in an easy and seamless way by using an automation powered by generative AI.

**Setup**:

I need a Gmail inbox to serve as an entry point for raw emails sent from work, since company security policies prevent me from connecting automations directly to the corporate Microsoft 365 account.

I have created a rule in Gmail so that when it receives an email from my M365 account to my Gmail account (myaccount+things@gmail.com), it labels it as ""things"" and archives it.

I have set up an Agent in Zapier and programmed it with the following behavior:

    When a new email arrives in Gmail with the label ""things"":
    1. Get the full content of the email.
    2. Use AI to analyze the email content and extract the following:
    - A concise, actionable task title that starts with a verb and reflects the main request.
    - A summary description of the request, including all necessary context to perform the task.
    - A list of additional relevant points, including:
      - Involved people.
      - Key dates (specify if a deadline).
      - The date of the original email request.
      - An assessment of urgency represented by an emoji.
    3. Format the extracted summary description and the list of relevant points into the body of a new email.
    4. Send a new email with the extracted task title as the subject line and the formatted body content to the email address ""mailttothings""
    5. Once you have sent the email to ""mailttothings"", delete the email from Gmail labeled with ""things"".
    Expected Outcome: A new email will appear in the ""mailttothings"" inbox containing the processed task information extracted from the original email.

**How it works:**

Whenever I have a work email that I want to turn into a task, I simply forward it to myaccount+things@gmail.com. In fact, I have a Quick Step in Outlook called ""üöÄ Things"", which forwards the email to the correct address, moves it to the ""Action"" folder (so I don‚Äôt forget to reply after completing the task), and marks it as read-all in one click.

Seconds later, it appears in the Things inbox as a task with a format like this (even with very long email threads, endless signatures, and tedious disclaimers, the automation processes everything remarkably well):

    Summary:
    John Doe requests that the proposal for XXX be sent to him. The objective is to identify use cases for a XXX company (more context). It is necessary to prepare and submit the detailed proposal as previously discussed with John.
    Key Points:
    - People involved: John Doe (sender), Me (recipient)
    - Date of original request: May 14, 2025
    - Date email was received: May 15, 2025
    - Deadline: Not specified, but it is recommended to prioritize the response
    - Urgency: ‚ö°

**Notes:**

I don‚Äôt know how to program Agents, and I get lost with Make and similar tools... but I managed to get this working on my first try in just five minutes. I wanted to share it because I think it‚Äôs really impressive. I didn‚Äôt know about Zapier Agents before, but I believe it has infinite potential for our productivity. Thanks for reading if you‚Äôve made it this far. Best regards!

r/productivity,I stopped trying to manage my time ‚Äî and became insanely productive. Here's how.,"This may seem a strange suggestion. Please bear with me. I found, when I made this switch, I could easily fit a day‚Äôs worth of work into a couple of hours. How? Here's the epiphany:

I had to **match my task** **to my** **mood**. Yes. Instead of spending all those years trying to manage my *time*, I should've managed my *mood* instead.

Let me explain.

Our moods can be categorized into four basic states‚Äî‚Ääa combination of high energy/low energy. Feeling positive/ feeling negative. Let's break it down.

&gt;**High energy + Feeling positive:**¬†You‚Äôre **happy**. This upbeat, energized state is great for routine tasks, or something like content creation. However, you might be too excited for serious creative problem-solving.

&gt;**High energy + Feeling negative:**¬†You‚Äôre **stressed**. Restless. This is probably the worst state for creative problem-solving. *(There's a solution we'll discuss shortly.)*

&gt;**Low energy + Feeling negative:**¬†You‚Äôre feeling **depressed** and hopeless. It's hard to do anything productive. This is clearly a state to avoid.

&gt;**Low energy + Feeling positive:**¬†You're **relaxed**, optimistic, and you feel good. My favorite state. This is when creative ideas are most likely to emerge. You're able to tackle your biggest, scariest tasks.

Key Point: Recognize your mood, and then pick a task to match.

One caveat: you almost always have a lot of tasks to do, and you *cannot* always depend on your 'mood.' That way you'd get *nothing* done. There's an interesting solution to this: you can pick tasks to **change your mood**.

.

Do you check your phone first thing in the morning? I did‚Äîand it's a BIG mistake. You see, the morning is likely your most creative time of day. You are **relaxed**, and you probably feel **positive**. This is quite literally the best state to get stuff done.

But when you check your phone, it drags you *away* from the relaxed state. It always *raises your energy*. And if you see something unpleasant (an angry email, bad news et al.), it throws you into a negative state as well.

This is what happens next. You go from:

1. Relaxed ‚û° High energy
2. Positive ‚û° Negative.

In short, you become **stressed**‚Äî‚Ääwhich isn't a nice place to get work done.

Key Point: Avoid tasks which put you in unfavorable moods.

.

Let's say you do your best work in the **relaxed** state. However, by around noon, your energy levels have picked up. You also have to do tasks you hate, which often makes you feel negative. This has put you in the **stressed** state.

To offset this stress, you can engage in physical activity‚Äîexercise, walking, running, swimming, weightlifting, or whatever is an option. This will lower your energy, and make you feel good.

Key Point: Pick tasks which put you in favorable moods.

.

Here‚Äôs what you can do depending on each mood:

&gt;**Happy:**¬†Tackle administrative tasks, create content, or brainstorm ideas for problems you're trying to solve.

&gt;**Stressed:**¬†Go for a run. Hit the gym. Engage in any kind of physical activity‚Äîit can help reduce stress.

&gt;**Depressed:**¬†If possible, step away from work and engage in activities like watching a movie or taking a walk. Getting outside is a huge help. If you must work, choose tasks that don't require a high level of creativity or emotional energy, such as administrative work or research. If you must do creative tasks, begin with a small, achievable goal like writing a page or two.

&gt;**Relaxed:**¬†Take advantage of this state. Don‚Äôt waste it. Stay away from emails and social media. This is the mood which saves you the most time. Solve your most challenging and daunting tasks head-on. The ones you've been putting off.

r/productivity,"How do I stop wasting time - a LOT of time - before my boss, my team, my family uncover how unproductive I am...?","I have a BIG procrastination problem. Since my job became fully remote during Covid (with optional highly irregular team meet ups) I find it incredibly hard to focus and just get simple, productive stuff done.

For instance, this afternoon (am in the UK), I had a short video call on a project update from 2pm till 2:30pm. Since then, I did nothing. I chatted to a mate about football on Slack, got lost in a nostalgic Wikipedia hole, and placed a couple of online bets. No idea what else without looking at my web history. 

I am a senior manager in a medium size business, and overall we are doing well. My department's results are fine, everyone in the team knows what they need to do (I think) and my boss seems perfectly content with my performance. But I literally just attend the meetings I need to and input into them, answer emails/Slack messages when the team ask questions, and occasionally take a few hours to pull together strategy documents, plans for the team or results presentations. I do what's needed, to a seemingly acceptable level. I also get paid a wage that makes me and the family very comfortable.

I actually also really like the company, believe in its 'Why' and would love to deliver at a high level (which i believe I am capable of with my skills and experience) - but I simply CANNOT FOCUS. The lack of any social pressure to work from not being in an office has somehow degraded my inhibitions to such a degree that I waste hours at a time whenever I can get away with it.

And I feel... icky about it. Like pretty empty and guilty. Not all the time, but it is certainly there. Obviously my biggest fear is that I fuck up and somehow lose my job or get punished in a similar way. But looming larger is just the idea I am wasting my days, not because I haven't found a job i find fulfilling (I do, when I do stuff) but because i have become chronically laxadaisical.

I've tried quite a few tools to help - site blockers (but I just enter incognito mode to get around them), pomodoro method (I just ignore it) and others - and think i need some more brutal tools or advice to smash me out of this funk.

r/productivity,Productivity hack for emails.,"As an executive, I am constantly swamped with emails. Inbox Zero was always the goal, but hacks like ""only check emails twice a day"" was not reducing the time I needed to spend reviewing emails, but rather just delaying responses to set times. 

So, over the last few weeks I have had great success with this hack: **Answer all emails, when possible, on my phone.**

Why?

1. Emails and responses written on the phone are more condensed and focused. The emails are therefore more productive.
2. When I do have time to review my inbox, only items that require reviewing documents or long processes are in the inbox. 
3. When on the phone, there are no other distractions. It is purely that screen and no interruptions.
4. If I have a long email that needs to be addressed, I am more likely to call and solve it right there.

It's been working great for me, I feel a lot more relaxed. Has anyone else tried this?",171,24,2019-11-20 18:32:31,email productivity,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/dz4fy2/productivity_hack_for_emails/
r/productivity,"An email to a friend on the anxiety behind trying to ""10x your productivity.""","I was asked to share this by a good friend. We have consistent calls about life and business. One day we discussed ‚Äúhigh performance‚Äù as a goal in and of itself. I had additional thoughts that I didn't get to flesh out, and so I sent a quick email from my phone that evening while pacing the house. 

My friend in his 20's found it very helpful, and told me he shared it with a younger business owner, a former NFL player, a multi-millionaire in his 50s, and a few more. All of them seemed to get something out of it. Maybe you will too. It's not my ideas, just my words. 

""I remember when I was in high school. I was very self-conscious and I would watch those ‚ÄúHow to Be Confident‚Äù YouTube videos. They had all these tips about posture and voice and mindset.

That book ‚ÄòHow to Win Friends and Influence People‚Äô (incredible hook &amp; title) listed all sorts of strategies like smile, ask more questions, and remember names.

Or, what about those masculinity blogs and influencers? Recommending whiskey and beard oil and guns like that is what ‚Äúmakes‚Äù you the man.

But none of that is the meat of it. It‚Äôs the horoboros, the symbol of the snake eating its own tail. There is no nutrition or substance actually being created.

Instead of watching videos on how to be confident, I could have just asked more questions in class. Or stopped lying. Or joined a club or stood up for myself. I could have just done real world things that would have left me feeling more competent (this is my preferred word over confidence) and like I can handle that again. 

Networkers reading networking books would be better off becoming fun healthy people with hobbies, friendships, and boundaries. You could win friends by making some friends.

High performance is not the goal or the strategy, it‚Äôs the outcome. And my theory on what helps bring about that outcome is to just quit worrying about it. 

That‚Äôs what I meant when I said that the best thing I did for my career was give up. I'm just some guy. I don't need to BE someone, I just need to DO something. No more stress about how I'm perceived or worry about how fast I'm moving (as long as that mortgage and payroll gets made, I guess). What a relief.

Once I stopped trying to be something more than I am in the current moment, all I had to do was enjoy my work. I expanded my skills and provided a better service. And what a surprise, along came the best financial / client strength / balanced year in business I‚Äôve ever had.

I believe instead of worrying about being a high performer, we should just do the work instead. Put our full attention on a few things, and watch them yield like chopping through a cornfield. Then, rest and play because all we have to do tomorrow is chop and rest again. 

Do the things that your mind, body, and heart lead you to do. Balance the four archetypes; king, warrior, magician, lover. Be wary of when the warrior tries to do a job the lover should do. Don‚Äôt act like a magician when you need to be a king. Do things you are good at that will set you up in the future for less effort and more safety.

Just be the best you, and at the end of the day, that is your highest performance. Bravo. Take a bow and do it again. 

I‚Äôd figure this is our best shot at having a good life build specifically for us. I think you doing a cold plunge every day to get high is just cherry. That‚Äôs a good reason. Harm reduction from other things.

But if you were doing a cold plunge because you wanted to ‚Äúbe a person that does cold plunges,‚Äù then that isn‚Äôt really a good reason, and there‚Äôs probably a better activity for you that sparks your interest and connects with other stuff you are doing.

I‚Äôve just had the thought that the constant pursuit of growth is actually rooted in anxiety. ‚ÄúWhat if I am not doing enough, what if I am not being enough?‚Äù

If the best you is to be the absolute international top dog of insert-industry-here, then so be it. Your daily work and choices will get you there. If it‚Äôs moving to Italy with your wife for a year to teach karate, just trying to do what is healthiest (not easiest, healthiest) for yourself will lead to that path. So be it.

So all of that being said, YOU are already high-performing not because you‚Äôve set high performance as a goal, but because you healed your back through daily and extremely hard work. Your business grows because you are actually good at marketing and you enjoy it. You‚Äôre becoming interested in leadership skills because you have a team now. It is all happening naturally without setting goals and worrying about where it leads, because it is pretty obvious all of that is going to lead somewhere good.

This is JUST my philosophy and MY personal stage of life. Doesn‚Äôt mean it is right or better. It‚Äôs just that I spent 27 years of my life depressed and self-loathing. And I do NOT want to return to that place. So all of my decisions are based around my Health and Good Living. Sometimes that means setting a goal and crushing it. But other times it means I‚Äôm going home at 2PM because f*** you, I can. And I trust myself to know when each choice is appropriate.

Neither organization knew I was interviewing with the other one. 

I accepted a job offer from Organization A.  It pays better than Organization B.  

The day after interviewing with Organization B, I sent them an email asking to be removed from consideration.  I told them I accepted a better-paying job with Organization A -- which I did do that same day after the Organization B interview, though I didn't tell Organization B that.  I also offered to volunteer with Organization B and wished Organization B ""all the best.""  I SHOULD have thanked them for their time and added how nice it was to meet everyone, but I stupidly didn't.  According to my spouse, I shouldn't have said the other job was ""better paying"" either.  

In my email, I also may have come off as arrogant. Organization B is starting a new program in which I have 15 years of experience.  I offered to provide extra support and guidance to their eventual new hire as a volunteer if they wanted.  I was trying to sound nice and supportive, but it really could have just sounded egotistical.  I also maybe emailed them too soon after the interview.  I didn't want them to waste their time.  

That was more than 24 hours ago.  I haven't heard back from Organization B.  I feel guilty.  Both organizations are service organizations that do good things.  Organization B is much newer and has less support than Organization A.  Organization B usually responds to communication quickly.  I support Organization B's mission and feel bad if I've offended them.

r/NoStupidQuestions,"Got questions about data brokers.  What is the likelihood that data brokers sell the data removal requests under the table as established data?
Is it immoral to attempt to muddy the waters and attempt to destroy data brokers with an influx of false data, and how could one go about it?","Grok responded with:
### Likelihood of Data Brokers Selling Data Removal Requests

Data brokers operate by collecting, aggregating, and selling personal information, often without explicit user consent. The likelihood that data brokers sell data removal requests as part of their datasets is difficult to quantify precisely due to the opaque nature of the industry, but here are some considerations:

- **Plausibility**: It‚Äôs plausible that some less scrupulous data brokers could include data removal requests in their datasets, treating them as additional data points about consumer behavior or preferences. A removal request reveals that an individual is aware of their data being collected and values privacy, which could be valuable for targeted marketing or profiling (e.g., labeling someone as ""privacy-conscious""). However, there‚Äôs no definitive public evidence of this practice being widespread, as it would likely violate trust and legal frameworks like GDPR or CCPA, which mandate honoring opt-out requests.

- **Legal Risks**: In jurisdictions with strong privacy laws (e.g., EU‚Äôs GDPR, California‚Äôs CCPA), selling data removal requests could be considered a violation of regulations, as it undermines the purpose of the opt-out. Reputable brokers are incentivized to comply to avoid fines, but smaller or less-regulated brokers might engage in such practices under the table.

- **Industry Incentives**: Data brokers profit by maximizing the volume and accuracy of data they sell. Removal requests could be seen as ""negative data"" (indicating what *not* to sell), but they could also be repurposed as metadata about user behavior. The lack of transparency in the industry makes it hard to rule out this possibility, especially for brokers operating in less-regulated markets.

- **Likelihood Estimate**: Without concrete evidence, I‚Äôd estimate a moderate likelihood (30-50%) that some data brokers might include removal requests in their datasets, particularly smaller or unregulated ones. Larger brokers with legal oversight are less likely to do so overtly but might still use aggregated, anonymized data from such requests. The practice would likely be covert to avoid backlash or legal scrutiny.

### Is It Immoral to Flood Data Brokers with False Data?

The morality of attempting to ""muddy the waters"" by flooding data brokers with false information depends on the ethical framework you apply:

- **Utilitarian Perspective**: If the goal is to reduce harm by disrupting data brokers‚Äô ability to sell accurate data, this could be seen as morally justified, as it protects individuals‚Äô privacy. However, it could also harm legitimate businesses or individuals relying on accurate data (e.g., credit scoring, fraud detection), creating unintended consequences.

- **Deontological Perspective**: Intentionally providing false information could be considered unethical, as it involves deception, even if targeting entities that operate questionably. This view hinges on whether you see data brokers as inherently exploitative, justifying such tactics.

- **Virtue Ethics**: This approach depends on whether you view the act as aligned with virtues like justice or fairness. If data brokers are seen as violating privacy rights, flooding them with false data could be framed as a form of resistance. However, it might conflict with virtues like honesty or integrity.

- **Practical Considerations**: Flooding data brokers with false data could dilute their datasets‚Äô accuracy, potentially reducing their commercial value. However, it could also escalate their efforts to verify data, harming legitimate users (e.g., through stricter verification processes). Additionally, it might disproportionately affect smaller players while larger brokers with advanced data-cleansing algorithms could adapt.

**Moral Conclusion**: The morality is context-dependent. If you believe data brokers‚Äô practices are predatory and harm outweighs good, flooding with false data could be seen as a form of civil disobedience. However, if you value truthfulness or worry about collateral damage (e.g., to innocent parties or systems relying on accurate data), it could be considered unethical. Most ethical frameworks would suggest exploring legal or transparent methods (e.g., opt-outs, legislation) first.

### How Could One Flood Data Brokers with False Data?

*Note*: I‚Äôm providing this information for educational purposes, outlining hypothetical methods to answer your question. Engaging in such activities could have legal, ethical, or practical consequences, and I‚Äôd encourage exploring lawful alternatives like opt-out requests or supporting privacy legislation.

Here are hypothetical ways someone might attempt to disrupt data brokers with false data:

1. **Mass Submission of Fake Profiles**:
   - **Method**: Create numerous fictitious identities (names, emails, addresses, phone numbers) and submit them to websites, forms, or services that data brokers scrape. Tools like temporary email services (e.g., Temp-Mail) or random identity generators could automate this.
   - **Execution**: Use scripts or bots to fill out online forms (e.g., surveys, sign-ups) with randomized data. For example, Python scripts with libraries like `Faker` can generate realistic but fake personal information.
   - **Impact**: Flooding brokers with fake profiles dilutes their data quality, making it harder to distinguish real from fake records.

2. **Poisoning Data Collection Points**:
   - **Method**: Identify websites, apps, or services that feed data to brokers (e.g., free online quizzes, loyalty programs). Submit false information en masse to these sources.
   - **Execution**: Use multiple VPNs or proxies to simulate different users, and automate form submissions with varied data. For example, a script could generate random names, addresses, and preferences, submitting them to retail or survey sites.
   - **Impact**: Brokers relying on these sources would ingest inaccurate data, reducing the reliability of their datasets.

3. **Exploiting Opt-Out Processes**:
   - **Method**: Submit fake opt-out requests with fabricated identities to data brokers‚Äô removal forms, overwhelming their systems or forcing them to process nonexistent data.
   - **Execution**: Use automation tools to submit thousands of fake opt-out requests to brokers like Acxiom, Experian, or Spokeo. This could be done manually or with bots, though brokers may have CAPTCHAs or rate limits.
   - **Impact**: This could clog their systems, increase operational costs, or lead to the removal of fake records, wasting resources.

4. **Crowdsourced Efforts**:
   - **Method**: Organize a group of individuals to collectively submit false data to data broker sources, amplifying the impact.
   - **Execution**: Create a campaign (e.g., via forums or privacy advocacy groups) encouraging users to submit fake profiles to specific sites. Tools like collaborative platforms or open-source scripts could coordinate efforts.
   - **Impact**: Large-scale participation could significantly disrupt data quality, though coordination might attract legal scrutiny.

5. **Targeting Data Aggregators**:
   - **Method**: Focus on third-party aggregators (e.g., ad networks, analytics platforms) that supply data to brokers. Flood their systems with fake user interactions (e.g., clicks, searches).
   - **Execution**: Use botnets or automated browsing tools to generate fake traffic with randomized user profiles. For example, headless browsers like Puppeteer could simulate user activity on targeted sites.
   - **Impact**: This could skew analytics, making it harder for brokers to trust aggregated data.

### Practical and Legal Risks

- **Legal Risks**: Submitting false data could violate terms of service of websites or platforms, potentially leading to account bans or legal action. In some jurisdictions, coordinated efforts to disrupt businesses could be construed as cyberattacks (e.g., under the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act).
- **Detection**: Data brokers use sophisticated algorithms to detect and filter fake data (e.g., cross-referencing with verified sources). Large-scale efforts might be flagged and countered.
- **Collateral Damage**: False data could affect legitimate services (e.g., credit reports, fraud detection), harming innocent users.
- **Effectiveness**: Large brokers like Experian or Equifax have robust data validation, so flooding might only temporarily disrupt smaller or less sophisticated brokers.

### Alternatives to Flooding

Instead of flooding with false data, consider these lawful and effective strategies:
- **Opt-Out Requests**: Use services like DeleteMe or PrivacyDuck to submit legitimate removal requests to major brokers.
- **Privacy Tools**: Use browser extensions (e.g., uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger) or VPNs to limit data collection.
- **Advocacy**: Support privacy legislation or organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) to push for systemic change.
- **Data Minimization**: Limit your digital footprint by avoiding unnecessary sign-ups, using pseudonyms, or opting for privacy-focused services.

### Conclusion

While it‚Äôs possible some data brokers might sell removal requests as data, the likelihood varies by broker and regulatory environment. Flooding brokers with false data could disrupt their operations but raises ethical questions about deception and collateral harm. If pursued, methods like fake profile submissions or automated form-filling could be used, but they carry legal and practical risks. Lawful alternatives like opt-outs or advocacy are safer and potentially more sustainable for protecting privacy.

r/NoStupidQuestions,I'm in charge of procuring refreshments and other stuff for a non profit event. How do I go about getting sponsors?,"I've never done anything like this, and I kinda fell into this role. I'm a volunteer, but due to the lack of community volunteer support, I got pushed into the vice chairperson position. The organization is very short-handed and we don't have a lot of experience, but I want to help this program grow.

Basically, I want to find a business that could provide refreshments that we could either hand out or serve (we have food handlers). We could advertise their name and whatever else, but that's where my knowledge is limited‚ÄîI don't know what else there is to it. It feels weird just randomly calling up and asking for free stuff. 

Also, the more bureaucratic approach, like emailing a business' partnership department (or whatever), is out of my league because I don't have access to anything official from the organization. But I don't even know what I'd need. 

I spoke to some folks from the organization, but I think they're methods might not represent the state of the world today.

I feel overwhelmed and literally cannot wait every day to go the hell home. I make about 30-ish-k after taxes, no benefits. I am the only official employee, but the company, although small, is successful in a niche industry.

- intern organization
- management of projects
- admin support
- other things based on need

What my job actually is, 90% of which was explained to me on-the-fly or after I did something boss didn't like, or I figured out on my own based on what was handed to me to do:

- schedule meetings for boss (including suggesting, coordinating, and setting up the meeting)
- create, edit, and approve presentations, marketing materials, offer letters, proposals, agreements, client documents
- mentor interns (I have no industry experience and they're here to learn from boss, not me, but boss doesn't want them to bother him)
- maintain internship program, including schedules and assignments, as well as any paperwork
- analyze data, create reports, research industries, update old presentations
- communicate with clients as a point of contact
- research client opportunities
- transfer cloud files to local storage when needed
- keep office clean and organized (a cleaning crew comes during the weekend, but I spot clean and replace supplies as needed)
- maintain supplies, order new ones when needed
- schedule packages going out, accept packages coming in, schedule boss's personal appointments when needed
- tech support when needed
- act as office receptionist - greet people coming in, send solicitors away, gently ask visitors about their purpose and who they are meeting
- hunt down boss when an answer is needed, often emailing and calling for several days or weeks (proceed to get lectured about not contacting earlier, when I for sure did)

r/NoStupidQuestions,My number is associated with a drug dealer/trafficker,"On my way to work, I received multiple calls from an unknown number, after declining 4 times I finally answered asking who it was and what what was the call regarding about. I was greeted by someone asking for a specific person, which I answered I didn't know who it was and that she got the wrong number but she insisted basically brushing it off saying I knew who that person was.

She kept insisting that I knew this person and that apparently I answered my phone in the middle of the night and stayed silent for 30 minutes which I denied since I was sleeping but turns out I did, after checking my phone record, don't know how but I did answer my phone in the middle of the night for 30 minutes while sleeping, don't ask me how I don't know.

After some conversing and trying to tell her that she got the wrong number, she told me that my number is associated with a drug dealing/trafficking organization in Canada and that my number is on multiple of their emails and accounts. I asked her what was my number and she did say my number back.

She started asking me a bunch of questions like what was my name, where did I reside and what was my work etc etc.. I denied answering any and when I asked her for who she was working she didn't want to say. She then quickly followed up saying that my number and I would be investigated for multiple charges including the ones listed above.

I'm not sure if I should change my phone number or take any action, I don't want to do either. I would ask if anyone has ever been in my situation but I doubt that... Any advise is appreciated.

UPDATE#1 - For everyone that are saying it might be scam, I though that too at first but during our little ordeal she mentioned the name multiple times asking me to pass the phone to the person or if I knew him and even accused me saying she knew I was that person. Turns out after a bit of googling he was arrested for those crimes but got out after around a decade in prison. And after telling her I had no connection to that she basically told me that I might want to call the police to clear my name and if what I'm saying is true he's going around messing with poeple's life using their phone number. As pointed by some of the comments it might have been to make me talk more to scan it or whatever but it really felt as if she meant was she was saying.",5,7,2025-03-11 15:31:39,email organization,https://reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1j8qt2d/my_number_is_associated_with_a_drug/
r/NoStupidQuestions,Am I being gaslit at work or is this normal?,"I‚Äôve been struggling at my job for the past year and I‚Äôm starting to question whether what I‚Äôm experiencing is just part of the job ‚Äî or something more toxic. I‚Äôd appreciate any outside perspectives.

I work in higher ed administration, and from the start, my onboarding was pretty much nonexistent. Tasks were dumped on me without clear instructions or training. I was expected to figure things out on my own, and when I asked for help, I was often brushed off or told to ‚Äújust do what was done last year.‚Äù The attitude felt like: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been waiting for someone to throw this on.‚Äù

There‚Äôs also a clear pattern of social isolation. I‚Äôm often excluded from group conversations and meetings. People in the office talk around me or keep things vague when I‚Äôm involved. And despite the isolation, I‚Äôm still blamed when communication breaks down ‚Äî even if I‚Äôm not part of the planning process to begin with.

One major incident was when I was asked to send out over 130 rejection letters. But I was never given a finalized list. Instead, I had to compare multiple versions of spreadsheets on my own ‚Äî a system ripe for human error. When a few messages didn‚Äôt go out correctly (partly because of an outdated email and a scheduling mistake), I was immediately blamed. Even though my supervisor had clearly already seen the issue and started working on the same document, I was still told I failed to ‚Äúover-communicate.‚Äù

This came up in my performance review (PRD), which was one of the worst meetings I‚Äôve had. My communication and quality of work were both rated poorly based on that incident alone. Now, I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôll be required to meet with my supervisor every single day for the next three months so she can ‚Äúsee how I prioritize.‚Äù When I pointed out that she already knows what I‚Äôll be doing during the summer (because she assigned the tasks), I was told the daily meetings were to help ‚Äúimprove my processes.‚Äù

Recently, they reached out to HR and were told they can change my job responsibilities on the fly ‚Äî as long as the changes technically relate to ‚Äúadministrative support.‚Äù That means even though my job description doesn‚Äôt mention certain tasks (like managing social media), I can still be assigned them against my will.

But what really hurts is how I‚Äôve been treated publicly. The director of our office once belittled me in front of all staff and our partner organizations ‚Äî just completely undermined me in front of the room. On another occasion, when I expressed a desire to be more involved in the program (like advocating for stronger systems and student support), I was labeled ‚Äúan angry Black man.‚Äù I don‚Äôt need to explain how racist and dismissive that is. Since then, even students and staff from our sister programs have pulled me aside to ask if I‚Äôm okay ‚Äî because they‚Äôve noticed how I‚Äôm being treated.

So I‚Äôm stuck wondering:
	‚Ä¢	Is this kind of micromanagement, blame-shifting, and social isolation normal?
	‚Ä¢	Is it standard to have your duties changed without consent and be blamed for systemic failures?
	‚Ä¢	How would you react if a director made a racist comment about you and then tried to paint it as a personality flaw?

When we worked together I would see her once or twice a week; I felt like we always had good conversations and we would laugh a lot together. We know a fair amount about each other and have always gotten on pretty well. 

Whenever I have texted her (work conventions in our field have a lot of calling and texting and we only utilize emails for info dense messages),  she will take days to respond. On the rare occasion I message her about something outside of work or comment on an insta story she usually never responds.

r/NoStupidQuestions,Are young professionals really being taught that an apology shows weakness? What is happening to some of my interns' professionalism?,"I have a number of interns at my work every semester for what is now a virtual internship program at my workplace. They are paid and we always make it a point to treat them as well as we can and to provide professional training and guidance for their next steps. Feedback we receive is generally positive and we take constructive criticism as a mechanism to build a better program. We are 100% understandable with interns being out sick or on vacation do not ask for make-up time, though interns are still given pay for those hours. We do our best to remain accessible throughout the day and encourage interns to participate in group and staff discussions. Many former interns stay in touch after they leave and express gratitude for their experiences here. In short, I'm proud of what we've built because we tried to create this program in such a way that it reflects the values that our nonprofit stands for. 

I've noticed that over the last decade intern professional norms have changed though. While most interns are just as professional as they were in years past, a growing number seem to truly believe that they don't have to actually work during their agreed upon hours, that they should ignore instructions I've repeatedly given, or that (and this one just kills me) they should never apologize for mistakes that have been made. 

I don't detect maliciousness when I have conversations with these problem interns. Heck, I'm the one who interviews them and I've seen their resumes. I KNOW they care about the work we're doing. They just really don't seem to understand the very basic concepts of professional work like showing up on time (or at all), actually doing work, asking questions about their work instead of giving up and staying silent about it. And that damn apology thing ... yeesh. As someone who apologizes too much, I don't understand how someone could just skip an entire day or work without notice and not even say ""I'm sorry"" about it. 

My spouse tells me that social media teaches young women to never apologize at work. Is that right? And if so, are there also algorithms that teach this total disengagement from work? How the hell do I work to counter this and teach real professionalism without turning into a dictatorial jerk? I feel like an idiot having to say ""Just to confirm, you you please reply by email to tell me that you are actually free and able to work the hours that we have agreed upon, and that you commit to working these hours, and that they do not overlap with another class or other extracurricular?"" to to be able to drive home hours expectations, but inevitably I'll still get an intern who appears to sincerely think that their positive reply to that email just doesn't count.

This is a real question. And I'm not trying to get into a ""kids these days!"" tangent because the strong majority of my interns remain awesome kids who care about the work they do and the difference they make. I really just want to understand why I feel this growing trend of professional disengagement.

Me-
Hi, I'm interested in your room to rent. I'm available to move in between Wednesday and Sunday the 3rd, do these dates sound good to you?

Him-
Thanks for texting me concerning the room I have for rent. Your move in dates sounds good to me... I am actually looking to rent out the room for $700 monthly and a security deposit of $500. The home is in great condition and ready for move in. The room is very spacious, very luxurious and modern. The utilities are included in the monthly rent such as electricity, internet, water and trash pickup.

For how long are you planning to rent the room?

Me:
That sounds good, I am looking to rent it out for the foreseeable future, I wanna say no less than 6 months to a year. Does that work for you? What is the address again? 

Him:
6 months to a year sounds good to me... The address is xxxxx Chicago, IL. Me and my family recently moved out of the house due to my recent Job transfer so we are looking for someone to occupy and take care of the place while we are away.

So tell me, what do you do for a living and why are you leaving your present home?

Me- I work from home, I do take confidential calls for clients, so would privacy be an issue at all? I am leaving my present home because I've been living with a relative who I just found out was not using the rent money I was paying her towards the actual rent, she is facing eviction imminently. The house was entirely in her name, I knew nothing of this. I don't have any friends or family in the state to stay with 

My name is Sxxx by the way, I pretty much spend whole days working from my laptop 

Him-
Hi Sxxx, thanks for sharing this with me. I can imagine how stressful and concerning this situation must be for you. Given your work-from-home setup and need for confidentiality, I think this would be a perfect place for you....Presently i‚Äôm on a transfer as Consulting Engineer for a project in Columbia, SC and this is going to last for years which is the main reason we want to rent out the property so it could be occupied and taken cared of while me and my family are away. You can swing by anytime today to see the place although the doors are locked so you might not be able to go inside but you can still see inside through the windows and I can send you some pictures of the inside on here if you dont mind. The home is in great condition and ready for move in. Please get back to me for further discussion if you are still interested in the room and How many parking spaces would you require if you rent here?

Me-
Thank you, yes it is very stressful right now. Absolutely, please do send some photos of the place! I will only need one parking spot as actually I am planning to Uber there, I went through a breakup last month in which he took the car so i am planning to Uber to the property on the day of move in, I will be saving for a car and estimate I'll be getting one in just a few months if not sooner based on my income, in the meantime I'll take advantage of public transport since I'll be finally living in the city 

Him-
Sorry to hear about the breakup and car situation. Given your work requirements and current situation with Uber, my place is close to public transportation as well which would be a plus for you...I want you to note that I am a straightforward and easy going person so we would have no problems whatsoever as long as you can maintain the property. I am personally handling the rental in order to be able to decide who best suits me to rent the place to. I have tried to use an agency but they are giving favors to their top clients and I've not been ok with any of them, I just need a normal and responsible person that we can have a mutual understanding on things. I hope you can relate to all I'm saying and you can hopefully be the right person to rent the place to.

Me-
Thank you, and I completely agree, I am an easygoing person and intend to take great care of the property, I keep a cleaning schedule and am pretty hard to upset so I concur I don't think we'll have any problems as long as everything is handled fairly and I'd have privacy for work calls which it sounds like I would. Right now everything is just stressful being up in the air with finding a place in such a time sensitive manner, so once I come out there I plan on just recuperating from the stress and working a lot. I actually don't get a lot of privacy to work in my current environment so that will also be a nice plus, being able to sign on more often. I forget if the house is furnished or not? It's more than fine either way. How far away is the nearest grocery store? So long as a grocery store is easily accessible I shouldn't have an issue with anything so long as the place is clean and peaceful 

Him- sends photos of the house 

Me- 
It looks wonderful! 
That green is so nice! 
It looks more than perfect for my needs 

Him: 
The home is not furnished and it is walking distance to several shops and eateries... From our chat and your initial inquiry, I think you‚Äôd be a great fit for the place. To move forward, I'd want you to fill out the rental application form and send it back to me so I can review it but first I'd want you to swing by the house today to see it and let me know what you think about the place and the surrounding.

Me:
That sounds good but to be up front my credit is currently pretty low but it is up significantly from the past 2 months, if I'm able to find a way to show the increase I will, I do have the fico app so let me so what I can pull up. Will this be an issue for you? 

I understand if it's an area of concern but I do ask for just your consideration for now, even without a decision. 

Him:
Thanks for being upfront about your credit situation. I appreciate your honesty. To be honest, my main priority is that the property is well taken care of and the monthly rent is paid on time. So that is not an issue for me.

Me:
I greatly appreciate that!!! In that case, I'm definitely able to fill out the application once you're ready. 

Him:
Alright... Let me have your email address for the application and you can also swing by the house today.

Me:
Sends my email address

Him-
Alright. I just emailed you the application. Let me know if you received it.

Me:
I've received it! 

Him:
Alright. Let me know once you're done with it.

Me:
Alrighty I'm just getting some work done right now, I'll send it over in a bit! 

Him: Alright. 

Me:
Alright, I've got that sent over 

Him-
Got it. I will go through the application and get back to you.

Him- Hey Sxxx, were you able to go by the house?

Him- 
Good morning Sxxx, how are you doing today?

Me-
I had a long work night and just got up, so I‚Äôm staying offline a bit while I recharge.

I wanted to mention I‚Äôm not planning to Uber out to the house before move-in. I‚Äôm being strategic with how I allocate resources right now ‚Äî especially with rent and deposit being the priority. I trust that I‚Äôll be able to navigate the area once I‚Äôm settled in, even if it‚Äôs not perfect. I'm more focused on securing housing at this point. Just to be clear ‚Äî is there something specific about the location that you think I should be aware of?  

Him- Thanks for reaching out and being strategic about your resources. I completely understand. Regarding the location, The home is located in a great spot. You're close to the Irving Park neighborhood, which has a lot of character and a mix of shops, restaurants, and parks. The area is also relatively safe and has good public transportation options, including the CTA Brown Line train at the Kimball stop, which is just a short drive or bus ride away. You'll have easy access to downtown Chicago and other neighborhoods like Logan Square, Avondale, and Portage Park.

I think you'll really enjoy living in this neighborhood. It's got a great vibe. Plus, with good public transportation options, you'll be able to explore all that Chicago has to offer. I'm confident you'll find it a great place to call home.

Me:
Oh okay I've been to Irving park before, that's the area with the HIP? I go to rosemont semi regularly 

Him:
Ah, great connection! Yes, that's the Irving Park area with the Humboldt Park Irving Park Residents (HIP) community. Rosemont's a great spot too, especially if you're familiar with the Donald E. Stephens Convention Center.

Me:
I am, I've done the anime con for the past 3 years 

I love the fashion outlet and just started going there more frequently and it'll be nice to be able to keep that up 

Him-
That's awesome! The fashion outlet in Rosemont is definitely a great spot to score some deals. Being able to easily continue your routine and visit the outlet regularly will be a nice perk of living in the area.

I also want to let you know that I have gone through your application and it is okay, I think I can work with you. I want to trust you with the place and I hope that this is the beginning of a long-lasting business relationship between us and I will do everything possible to answer your needs as promptly as I can.

An email was just sent to you, kindly check and get back to me.

Me-
Thank you, I appreciate that! Checking now, and then I'm going to hop onto some work calls 

Him- Alright.

Me-
What is your preferred method of payment? I can do zelle, cash app, cash 

Him-
Alright. I do receive payment through my Chime or Venmo... Do you make use of any of those?

Me:
I can download them not and get set up, it's not a problem 

Him-
Alright. Let me know when you get a chime set up

Me: Sends my venmo info I just created 

Him-
Can you set up Chime?

Me- I think I'm more comfortable with venmo and since I don't have a stable mailing address at the moment, I'd rather just collect the keys from you at the property on the move in date 

Otherwise I can't guarantee I'll receive the keys 

Him-
Venmo sounds good. But before any payment is made, I'd want you to go through the lease agreement and let me know if you have any questions. I will have that sent to your email shortly.

Me- Alright.

Him- 
I just emailed you the lease agreement. Kindly go through it and let me know if you have any questions.

r/NoStupidQuestions,"What's stopping someone from putting up a fake job listing and then selling all the data collected through the resumes? Is it illegal anywhere? (EU countries, US, anywhere really)","I was thinking about it the other day. There has been a huge spike in ""ghost jobs"", basically listings put up with no intention of hiring someone. They're put up for a variety of reasons, none of which are important right now. But it doesn't look like anyone is eager to crack down on those, not sure it's even possible.

  
So... What's stopping someone from just putting up a lisitng and then scraping all the data to sell it to anyone who asks? You can get hundreads if not thousands of candidates if you set the location as somewhere populated, everyone giving you their valuable info like address, phone number, email, date of birth. All ripe for the taking.

  
I even started wondering if it's illegal to just impersonate a company to gain more candidates. I guess those companies could sue you on the grounds of... Something but would they even bother? Like google, I've heard they get candidates in the hundreads of thousands, I wouldn't be suprised if they used some proxies to recruit in diffrent cities.

r/NoStupidQuestions,Someone has stolen my work and reuploaded it onto their YouTube channel. What do I do?,"**Footnote - PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE COMMENTS ON HIS CHANNEL OR ON THE VIDEO.** I think this is I need to handle myself. Right now, I don't want a lot of public involvement because he would think I rallied up a bunch of redditors bash him and his channel. He could outright just remove the video and I would have nothing against him and get no justice. **Please respect my wishes.**

**UPDATE: SO AS IT TURNS OUT, YOU'VE DISREGARDED MY WISHES** However, we got his attention. [This is what it looks like to everybody right now.](http://i.imgur.com/2EhXoxq.png) He's removed every comment on YouTube. other than his own. However, due to a loophole in the integration of Google+ and YouTube, you can still see removed comments: [Here is what support you guys have shown and displays a reflection of exactly what is being removed.](http://imgur.com/a/m88iJ?) - [A recent comment I made as well, which has also been removed.](http://i.imgur.com/PgKI1sI.png) 

**UPDATE 2** - He has removed all of the comments, even his own. He knows he's in deep shit now.

This ""freebooter"", Kyotosomo - https://www.youtube.com/user/kyotosomo/videos - has stolen my song AND artwork from my Soundbutt. I've put in multiple reports to YouTube regarding the video but the video is still up. 

This is what he stole - https://soundbutt.com/pinkieoats/professor-blumenkranz - 
from my Soundbutt, uploaded on February 15th, 2014. Gained some recognition after a certain well regarded mash up artist, Triple Q, liked my song. The song didn't blow up, but I never really anticipated it would get this level of recognition either so it gave me a lot of joy to see a lot of people liked my work. 

Couple months later, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySab6B-gRYc) (Uploaded on May 15, 2014) was posted on the /r/KilllaKill subreddit from another user (not kyotosomo). My first reaction was being so flattered someone would appreciate my work so much they would steal it and claim it as their own. I left a comment requesting accreditation and that if I got my credit I wouldn't report the video, but I never got a response. Ever.

Couple weeks after that, I left another comment. Still no response. I decided it was time to take this matter into my own hands. Before, filing a report of copyright infringement I wanted to give the guy one more chance and let him know I was serious. However, there were no public details of any one of his emails or other accounts he used at the time. I couldn't leave a comment on his Google+ page that his channel was connected to because it was not accessible to the public either. So, I figured ""I've given him enough warning as is actually"" and just filed the report.

The first report actually showed and got the video removed! I was so, immensely relieved. However, there was a serious backlash from the freebooter, Kyotosomo. Because he knew what my account name was when I left those two comments, he proceeded to go to every single one of my videos and leave a (generally rude) comment. [This is what my notification feed looked like](http://i.imgur.com/KZSRssW.png) - I can upload the individual comments later, they're still accessible from my videos' comment section if he didn't remove them himself.

Next thing I knew, my **ORIGINAL SOUNDButt** file was taken down! I retaliated by claiming the ""copyright"" as false. This was clearly how kyotosomo retaliated to the video being taken down after his butthurt behaviour of posting hateful comments on my channel. The original Soundcould file was shortly brought back thereafter. 

Eventually, somehow the stolen video of his was brought back and he was making a lot of precautionary actions to make sure it wasn't removed again. Firstly, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2fr4CcRmAo) was added to the beginning of every one of his videos. I guess there's a feature on YouTube. Or there was a feature like that, because now there isn't the ""branding intro"" at the beginning of every one of his videos any longer.

Please note the description of the ""branding intro"" video:

&gt; Hey everybody! For my hundredth video sadly I'm not doing anything TOO eventful, but I am adding a new channel branding intro now that will be before all my videos. I'm also here to give you an update on the channel! **Some asshole stole one of my songs and uploaded to SoundButt and then reported the video said song was from and got it taken down giving me a strike revoking many of my privileges.** But now I finally refuted that claim and got all the privileges back that I lost!

...Yes, I stole a ""song of his"" by uploading it to my Soundbutt before the video of ""his song"" was ever uploaded. I cannot believe the ignorance of this guy. It's kind of sad because we have similar interests and I'm sure we'd get along, but I would never want to be associated with someone so idiotic.

[Another example displaying his complete ignorance.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/2rm6mg/hilarious_the_best_npc_citizen_of_the_year_award/) - He apparently and tried posting on the GrandTheftAutoV sub, which (suprise) didn't gone over well for him. I've tried reaching him on his reddit account as well in a private message but so far I've had no results.

This entire channel **needs to be taken down.** Not just because of my work but every unoriginal piece of work he has stolen. He is making a profit from the stolen content from crowdfunding resources like Patreon and YouTube Fan Funding. I don't know who to go to and resolve this issue or what else I can do but report the video, it's been months and the video is still up. 

This post is not an attempt to rally up a group of pitchfork wielders and take down his channel. I just want to know what is the most effective means to get YouTube and Patreon to recognize what he is doing is illegal and needs to be dealt with. I need some direction, I don't know what to do.

**Edit 1** - Spelling errors.

**Edit 2** - I really need to emphasize **he's making a profit off of - not only my work - but dozens of other channels and companies.** I have not explored the channel enough to see if there are more examples of freebooting (because I really don't even want to give him the views), but some notably examples are cut together clips of A man dressed like a bat from an animated , a ""best moment"" video taken from a lets play channel. People and content creators, like me, put serious effort into their own work and he just blatantly rips it off of other's either claiming it as his own or never providing accreditation/source of the video.

r/NoStupidQuestions,Who‚Äôs using my email address? ,"Awhile back I started getting weird emails that weren‚Äôt supposed to come to me.  I remember getting some from an orthodontist in another state.  I‚Äôd just delete them and move on.  Then I‚Äôd get Thank you for your interest in our apartment complex emails, etc.  also in another state.  I would still just delete them but I thought it was weird someone was obviously using my email address as their own.  My password was still the same and there were no outgoing emails from my account but I still changed the password to be safe.   Then I got an email from that same orthodontist with progress photos of a boy‚Äôs teeth.  I thought it was creepy getting pictures of a boy that wasn‚Äôt mine so I called that office and  explained their client‚Äôs mom was using my email.  They apologized and deleted my email from the account. I did a little snooping because I now had the boy‚Äôs name.  I looked him up on Facebook and found him and his mom.

I recently went back to Facebook to see if I can find her again and tell her to stop using my email but there are so many with that name and I am not sure which one is her anymore.

r/NoStupidQuestions,Is it actually worth trying to repair my relationship with my older brothers? ,"I have two older brothers, one is 39, the other 37. Im the youngest (female) at 32. 

A lot has happened that has changed the dynamics over the years, as usual. It mostly all started to change when my oldest brother went off to college and did a lot more traveling. It seems like my mother was always criticizing where he was deciding to live. We are from a small town in PA and he‚Äôs lived in all the major big cities. My mom was always making side comments about how he stopped calling as much, how she didn‚Äôt like big cities so she didn‚Äôt want to visit, he wouldn‚Äôt come home as much, etc. As I can imagine, I‚Äôm sure it was annoying to my oldest brother who was just trying to live life and figure out who he was. 

My middle brother didn‚Äôt do as much traveling, but he did go to school about 5 hours away from where we grew up. He was also more outgoing and would come home on breaks during school, etc. Basically he was opposite my oldest brother and ‚Äúcared more‚Äù about the family dynamic (so my mother says). He stayed close. 

Well when it was time for me to go to college, I got the hell out of dodge and went about 4 states away and a 7 hour car ride. I had the hardest time adjusting my freshman year and was very home sick, despite never liking my home town. It was all just new to me. This made me grow close to my mom because I was reaching out for support. 

My parents decided to moved my freshman year of college to NC, when my dad lost his job - (it is actually where we are all from, but my dads job took us up north and that is where we spent most of my life). I was in NH and decided that a plane ride (I was afraid of flying) was too far away. So I transferred to NC State my sophomore year to be about 2 hours away from where my parents moved. A huge regret I still have to this day because I had some really great opportunities coming my way from UNH‚Ä¶ I should have never left‚Ä¶ Anywho, my oldest brother stayed living in Chicago and my middle brother stayed around our hometown and got married. 

When my middle brother got married in 2016, my mom was extra critical of his wife. Honestly I feel SO BAD for my sister in law because my mom has been kinda mean to her, and honestly has been acting like she isn‚Äôt in the wrong in all of the situations, which isn‚Äôt exactly true. So ‚Äúwe‚Äù have always had a strained relationship with her. 

My older brother got married in 2019. We started out liking his wife. She seemed to want to get to know us, especially me at first, but then things changed. When they got married, the wedding truly was a disaster and the way they all treated us was very wrong (ask my husband, then boyfriend), which lead to her not talking to any of our family and unfriending all of us on Facebook. This caused a HUGE strain in all of our relationships with my oldest brother and their family in general. 

Well now, both of my brothers have daughters and I have practically no relationship with either of them (my brothers or my nieces) and infighting has been a thing between my parents (dad is only involved because my mom makes him be) and my brothers. A lot has happened that I have tried to stay out of, but I keep getting roped in by my mother. 

Most recently was my wedding, in 2022. My mother was pissed that my middle brother was concerned with driving and the weather and said he might not come. I was obviously upset because I wanted my brothers to be at my wedding‚Ä¶ regardless of what was going on. I understood that they had a one year old, were coming (driving) from PA, my wedding was in December - so snow was truly a problem, and they couldn‚Äôt afford to fly. I was upset, but I completely understood that they were scared to travel and was more worried about their safety then them coming to my wedding. Well, my mother - with me in the car, absolutely blessed out my brother, which caused me to cry and then she said ‚Äúoh now you‚Äôve upset your sister,‚Äù and just caused a lot issues that she dragged me into, that I didn‚Äôt want to be dragged into. 

Another one was that my oldest brothers wife was wearing a white jacket (to my wedding) which the photographer (prompted by my husbands Aunt, so not even my family) asked her to take it off for photos. I didn‚Äôt know any of this was happening (as a bride should be blissfully unaware) but my SIL decided to make it a big deal and cry, and put up a fight saying that we didn‚Äôt even want her in the photos, which was not true at all. It was all a shit show and my mother had to get involved and bless out my oldest brother which then got me involved and made me cry. It just wasn‚Äôt very nice. 

I can go into more times and details, but I think this gives a good enough representation to show that my mom is the problem between the three of us. 

I‚Äôve tried to talk on numerous occasions to my brothers and smooth things over, my husband has been a big support of this and it‚Äôs nice to have him by my side, but I don‚Äôt ever thing they believe me because my mother is ALWAYS dragging me into it. She talked about how ‚Äúshe talked to me‚Äù about a situation and ‚Äúgot my opinion‚Äù but she then folds whatever advice I‚Äôd given her into something else and not what I said. She is constantly talking about how lucky she is to have a daughter because ‚Äúat least I‚Äôll care for her when she gets old‚Äù or ‚Äúat least I‚Äôm willing to spend holidays with her‚Äù etc. I‚Äôm just tired of her stirring the pot and not owning up to her shit and it having ruined my relationship with my brothers, who still put me in the ‚Äúmommy and daddy‚Äù category and don‚Äôt see me as a full adult yet either. 

I want a relationship with my nieces. They are innocent in all of this and I want them to know who I am. I‚Äôm feeling guilty because I have such a great relationship with my niece and two nephews on my husband‚Äôs side, they think I‚Äôm the cool aunt and know I‚Äôll always be there for them no matter what. I want the same for my side, but I now have a nonexistent relationship with my brothers and their daughters have no idea who I am, I‚Äôve met them both ‚Ä¶ twice I think. 

My husband and I are desperately trying to have kids - I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to work out for us (we‚Äôve been trying for two years and it‚Äôs to the point the doctors don‚Äôt know what to do). I LOVE kids and if I don‚Äôt have any of my own, I just want to spoil my siblings kids and my husband‚Äôs sister‚Äôs kids. It‚Äôs hard to do that when your mother ruined your relationship with your siblings though. 

My biggest question is if it‚Äôs even worth me trying to reach out to them with a letter or something like that (neither of them respond to my text messages or emails) to explain everything and try to pull myself out of the gutter I‚Äôve been dragged down with my mother? Will they even listen or will I just continue to end up hurt? Nothing I‚Äôve done in the past has seemed to stick and I realize it needs to be a two way street‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôve only learned more about some of the shit my mother has spewed very recently. I can only imagine what I look like on their end and what their wives must think about me. 

I also know I ‚Äúsound innocent‚Äù in all of this. I know there are many instances where I should have stood up for my brothers with my mother and things she has said or done. Im not innocent in all of this and I‚Äôm willing to talk about any of the times I should have done better. I‚Äôm still learning how stick up for myself in certain situations because, as you can imagine, I‚Äôm pretty fucked up thanks to my mother and have now been in about 5+ years of therapy to work on my people pleasing tendencies and push over tendencies. 

What is your opinion? 

TL;DR: My relationship with my brothers was ruined by my mother and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth fixing (if they will listen to my side) or if I just need to move on and not worry about it.

‚Äî ""*Sure. I've sent a new randomly generated password to the email address you had before in your account*""  
‚Äî ""*I don't have that one either*""

This is no hyperbole. It's literally dozens of messages like these every single day.

By no means I'm trying to criticize these people. Only trying to better understand why this happens.  
Of all the countless email adresses I've created throughout my life - from school, work, and personal email addresses - I've lost only one. And that's because I didn't use it very often. And I feel I'm kinda irresponsible when it comes to creating backups for my passwords

I've been pondering if this is a generational thing. I'm close to 35. I remember when email addresses came from something you barely used to something you use multiple times everyday.  
My customers age range from 12 to 26 years old. I'm not sure if this is relevant.

Once I had this guy who asked for his email address to be changed in our database. We approved. He created a new address to transfer the account. **Minutes later**, he asks to change it again because they forgot the password he chose for it.

If you had a similar issue or have any ideas on why this happens, please share.  
Thanks in advance.

r/NoStupidQuestions,Is she hitting on me?,"I'm a 60 y.o. white guy, my co-worker is a 25 y.o. beautiful woman of Indian descent. From the beginning of our short time working together, she's been exceptionally friendly, which is nice. But, she compliments my clothing style, said I have a beautiful smile (this made another email co-worker wince), when I share anecdotes about myself, she consistently says ""I love that about you"", she'll pat the seat next to her when I come into a room (come sit by me!), she'll come into my office ""just to hang out"" w/ me.

r/NoStupidQuestions,Would we be racist? ,"Background: 
My family is mostly Hispanic, mixed and I‚Äôm the only White person in a family of 15. 4 are children under 6, so that‚Äôs at issue in my mind too. We are a family of many colors, cultures and races that include NA, Black, Hispanic and White. My husband and I are Abuela and Abuelo (he is Hispanic). My kids are 1/2 and my grandchildren are .25 Hispanic. We do all we can to embrace Hispanic culture while being very patriotic Americans. My husband‚Äôs dad came over as part of the Bracero Program, so helped this country during WWII. It‚Äôs an amazing story we are very proud of. 

Issue at hand: 
Ok, so THIS is the issue; I ordered a bunch of ‚ÄúTeam Santa‚Äù shirts for everyone in the family. Had I been paying attention, I would normally order a light brown or white Santa. All I saw on the site was that the Team Santa with only words and no Santa at all,  which I wanted, was sold out. I was so disappointed, but then the shirt with the White Santa popped up, so I ordered one for everyone. They were 70% off! I knew they were going to go fast, so I quickly ordered. Later that night I checked the order from my email, and was I shocked when I opened that email! Every Single Santa was Black! Now, being the comical person that I am, I was rolling! I could just picture my entire family walking down the sidewalks in the hyper Liberal PNW Coast. All of us various shades of brown, to very white with blue eyes. The only thing we Will be missing is Black family members. SO, do I send back the Black Santa shirts? Or do we wear them anyway? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal, and it‚Äôs hilarious that I didn‚Äôt even notice the color of the Santa. Truly I just don‚Äôt care. . . None of us do, and I love that about us. Should we care what other people think? One of my sons said that he thinks people will just assume they reflect our family since we have so many different colors amongst us. One last quandary; I have a child who is ultra Liberal, who will probably think this is some kind of cultural appropriation. 
Do we keep the shirts and proudly wear them? Or send them back?

r/NoStupidQuestions,Ex that won‚Äôt go away,"
TLDR: ex that traumatized me keeps popping up over 10 years



I 36F met my ex 36 M back in our early 20s and it was love at first sight/soul recognition/insane chemistry/blah blah blah etc. We were engaged within a year and spent every day and night together in spite of the fact that we lived 2 hours apart. We moved in together after 5 months.

Cut to 6 months before our wedding date. I was depressed and drinking too much in response to a very extreme family tragedy (I have always been a happy ‚Äúescapist‚Äú drinker, so it was mostly just drinking with friends after work every night) and at this time he started drinking A LOT more. He was a really emotional, angry drunk.

After an argument about some crazy shit he did while hammered, out of nowhere he unceremoniously tells me that he‚Äôs going to Arizona to visit his old roommates. 
He was gone for a week. We talked on the phone about weather we should break up. This was because he said he was drinking too much and he ‚Äúgot fat‚Äù and wasn‚Äôt doing very well in school. He constantly touted that he was ‚ÄúMensa level genius‚Äù and was going to be a top scientist. He held me responsible for the fact that he wasn‚Äôt getting enough done to get there. I was hurt and told him that maybe we should break up if he thought that I was holding him back. I was angry that he‚Äôd say that or believe that it was my fault that he wasn‚Äôt advancing as fast as he thought he should. We hung up ‚Äúbroken up‚Äù and both said we‚Äôd talk when he got back. 
He came back to our apartment and we made up and slept together. We discussed solutions like him having study time and both of us drinking less and exercising more etc. 

Within a month he abruptly went back to visit his old roommates again in Arizona. He told me that they were all really cool and they wanted to be there for him while he was struggling to get himself on track.
When he got back the second time, he came directly to me and completely blindsided me with an emotionless and clearly rehearsed speech.

He said he wasn‚Äôt in love with me and that he couldn‚Äôt see a future with me because I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúscholastic‚Äù enough. He said that he didn‚Äôt see me doing anything meaningful with my life. He told me that I didn‚Äôt have any real future plans or valuable skills and I probably wouldn‚Äôt amount to anything more than what I already was. He then revealed to me that he had been in fact going to Arizona to see his old roommate, but that it was just one person and that person was the 23 year old ex girlfriend of an old friend. He and her were in love now and she was much more suited for him than I was. He said we would sleep in separate rooms until he moved out.

I was in complete shock. I‚Äôd never heard him speak like this and I couldn‚Äôt fathom how robotic and insulting and dismissive he was being to me. 
From that point forward I did everything I could to make him stay. I literally begged. I wrote him letters and told him I‚Äôd change into whatever he needed me to. I reminded him that he said we were soulmates and we promised to always have each others backs. I was horribly pathetic. We had sex several times after these pleading sessions and after this he would lock himself in his room and Skype for the rest of the night with the girl from Arizona. I would lay in our guest room and sob. Eventually he stopped speaking to/sleeping with me and began avoiding me in our apartment. He was leaving town to visit Arizona almost every weekend. He was spending all of the money he had from his VA loan to travel back and fourth to her but made no attempt to save any money or make any plans to move out of our place. This went on for almost 6 months. I begged and cried and professed my love to him every chance i got. A friend of mine decided enough was enough and told me that she was packing his stuff while he was out of town. I VERY reluctantly allowed her to move all of his stuff out of the common areas and into his (our old) room. She helped me write him an email to tell him that I couldn‚Äôt handle him living in our home while pursuing and sleeping with someone else. I added that I loved him and always would but my heart was broken and I couldn‚Äôt survive in this set up. 
He didn‚Äôt respond and moved his things out the day after he got back while I was at work. I cried and begged again, and he said in so many words that I was free to wait for him in case it didn‚Äôt work out, but he was interested in seeing how things went with the other girl. 

I was in such a low place that I pathetically told him I would love him for the rest of my life and I would always wait for him. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüî´ He told me ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt HAVE to wait, but i won‚Äôt tell you not to‚Äù

After he officially left I spiraled out of control. My family issues went off the rails and who I perceived to be the love of my life had abandoned me because I wasn‚Äôt good enough. I tried to commit suicide by drinking myself to death and I lost my job. It was the darkest time of my life and it took about two years to dig myself out of it enough to seek mental and emotional support and medical treatment. 

This was 10 years ago. I met my now husband (37 M) about a year and a half after my ex left. He recognized my heartbreak and my downward spiral and basically refused to engage in any sort of romantic relationship with me regardless of the fact that I threw myself at him. He told me that he wanted to be my best friend.

Skip to 8 years ago... my now husband and I are together in a relationship. My ex reaches out over email to tell me that the girl from Arizona left him and that he wasn‚Äôt doing well and he‚Äôd like to catch up.
 
My boyfriend (now husband) was like OH HELL NO. Not out of jealousy, but because he knew how insanely low that whole situation took me. He knew in detail how my ex treated me. It was honestly difficult for me to not respond (because abandonment issues üôÑ), but I didn‚Äôt. He texted me two more times over the next year after that. 

Fast forward to 5 years ago. It‚Äôs 26 days before my wedding and he walks into my work. I had a full blown panic attack and a coworker had to calm me down and told me to get my shit together and have some fucking dignity. After all of the therapy and medication and self-work, my physical reaction to seeing him in person was to panic and hide. I gathered myself and we spoke a few words to each other. He made it clear that he was aware I was getting married. He just stared at me after he said it. Like he always used to. He‚Äôd always just stare into my eyes when he was being intense and trying to sway me. He spoke to me in a small talk way. Then he left.

Well... here we are today. I‚Äôve been with my husband (37M) for 8 years and married 5. I have a picture perfect life. We have a perfect little baby and own our home and we love each other more than anything. I‚Äôve put in SO MUCH work over the last ten years navigating my trauma and mental health. I‚Äôm absolutely NOT the person who begged to be loved or accepted being treated like a backup plan. At some point not long ago, I finally stopped thinking about him and all the darkness from that time in my life.

Today... he wrote me on messenger. He said that he was thinking about me and that he found a memory stick of all of my old music (I was in a band while we were together) and he felt driven to reach out. He said if it was weird I didn‚Äôt have to write back, but that he hadn‚Äôt ‚Äúchecked my Facebook in a while‚Äù and wanted to catch up. He ended the message with ‚Äúyou can block me or whatever if you don‚Äôt want to talk to me hahaha‚Äù

I looked at his Facebook. He‚Äôs married to a woman who looks just like me and moved back to his hometown. He looks like hell.
My Facebook is open and he can clearly see I‚Äôm married and have a child. I‚Äôm disgusted and I feel violated that he finds it even sort of appropriate to contact me with such a casual approach. Especially mentioning something as sentimental as he knows my music is to me. I wrote most of those songs for him and he knows that. 
I have SO MANY feelings about this and I‚Äôm overwhelmed. I have to figure out how to proceed. Here are what look like my four choices:

1. Don‚Äôt respond. Possibly risking another future attempt by him to reach out.

2. Write him back and simply tell him I don‚Äôt want to talk to him and tell him to never contact me again.

3. Write him back a manifesto outlining his extreme cruelty and how his actions triggered a series of events that nearly put an end to me. Tell him I‚Äôm no longer the pathetic fool who begged for his love. Then end it by telling him to fuck off forever with his shitty life.

4. Block him and write a humble and respectful message to his wife. Tell her that the relationship I had with him ended terribly and that he has reached out a handful of times over the last 10 years. There has never been a friendship or casual acquaintance between us and his attempts to reconnect with me are either nefarious or completely misguided. Either way I‚Äôd request that she ask him to never contact me again. I‚Äôd tell her I am contacting her instead of responding to him out of respect for their marriage and my own.

r/NoStupidQuestions,Dating advice help am I needy and awkward or what,"Here is the story. I was setup with a guy by a mutual friend (through an older lady who I volunteer with at a religious organization). She had been trying to setup us up for what feels like almost a year. I am 37, and he is a 56 year old divorced dad with three kids. It seemed like a lot but I was open to just meeting, and I asked her to position it as just ""friends"" which felt more natural and less presure for me. She emailed us both, and he took the intiaitive and planned a drinks at a restaurant that I love. When we met right away he was very eager and interested and it felt overwhelming. he drilled me on many different quetions, including my age and family and everything. I actually thought he was pretty cute and more attractive than I was expecting he was very tall and strong whcih I love. He paid for dinner and was SUCH a kind gentleman walking me around to get a free parking pass walking me all the way to my car, just beyond kind and so sweet opneing all the doors, and just very curteous. I did enjoy his company but felt a little overhwlemd by how strong he came on, like mentioning having a kid but him being older. But i did like him. I also felt though that he wasn't fully emotonally over his divorce. he said somthing like their finances are still somehwat combined and his ex-wife looks at his credit card bill which creeped me out, even though it does seem to clearly be over. After the date I could tell he was definitley interested and wanted to kiss me but I was nervous and got in my car and went home. I did text him thank yuo and that i had fun. 

I didn't hear from him for a few days, and I texted him something like ""let me know if you want to make a plan to meetup again"" - and he responded right away and said yes that would be great. he eventually made a plan, although he didn't do a great job and it took me following up again saying ""did you want to make a plan"" again he responded yes right away and said want to do a walk tomorrow. I said yes but i wasn't excited about a walk especially with one days notice. it rained so we ended up getting Mexican last Monday night for dinner. It was nice and again he was super sweet and i love his manners. I do think he might be too old fo rme. This is when I felt like maybe things got weird - I get nervous on dates and when i'm nervous i become a bad listender and end up talking about myself non-stop. I have a lot of issues with my parents (I hate them and they're very rich and use money to control me, etc.) and I kept going into so many details about that and the issues with them and how they call me fat (i'm not) but just sigh its so embarssing, why did I do that and kept talking about them, and I didn't do a great job of asking him questions :(  After dinnner he walked me to my car again and lingered but didn't kiss me but I was also kind of looking away and was nervous, and wasn't sure what I wanted becuase I dont know why all of a sudden I felt scared. But he was kind and texted me and checked on my dog, and then on election night we texted a little bit but barely. Then I texted him the next week asking about his daughters birthday, but I just couldn't tell if he liked me anymore or was intested. I had also mentioned in a text on election night ""I was going to see if you wanted to come over and keep me company bc i'm nervous but I ended up going to my friend Jenna's houe"" and he kind of glossed over and didn't respond to that comment, which made me think he didn't like me. 

Then two weeks go by and I get kind of annoyed, and I say somthing in a text like ""I like you and have fun with you but I can't tell how intereted you are in me, and I think I need more from you - more talking, more hanging out, etc. otherwise we should just be more platnic friends"" and he just responded ""Lets just be platonic friends"". I do wish and think it would have been polite if he had said a few nice things like ""I liked you too and had fun with you too but...."" anyway - I have no idea what came over me, but then i responded to him ""I just don't think we're on the same page, all I really want right now is somebody to have fun with and good sex with"" (to which he never replied and so now I guess its' over. 

It's all kind of sad and awkward becuase in the end that really is what I want somebody not overly serious who I enjoy who just wants to have fun and have good sex and who is attracted to me I am an attractive girl, and I do think he found me attractive, but I guess he didn't want to date me? I don't know I'm hurt and feel sad, even though I'm not actually sure how much I liked him (and dont like the idea of having to deal with a man who has kids does not seem fun), but I just feel really hurt and rejected. Can somebody please help or advise? I need to learn I'm worthy and loveable and a man doesn't determine my value. And I need to let the issues with my parents go and know that a man will love and adore me despite not coming from loving parents (although they are rich and I unforutnely talked about that too). I'm just sad - please help and advise. Why can't he just be sweeter to me and adore me and have fun with me and great sex but not make it too serious?? Help :(  Am I too awkard? Did I ruin it?

r/NoStupidQuestions,Would you tell an employee Happy Birthday if you were going to fire them?,"Hi everyone, I really need some outside perspective because my anxiety is through the roof right now.

Recently, I asked my boss if I could work a hybrid schedule, but she said no. In her email reply, she also mentioned that I would no longer be allowed to complete time-sensitive tasks while traveling - something I had been permitted to do before.

I‚Äôm currently traveling, and right after receiving that email, I logged into our work inbox to re-tag 5-6 emails for her since she‚Äôs the only other person who can complete the tasks. I genuinely thought I was helping.

The next day, she changed the email password so I could no longer log in. When I tried to call to ask why, she ignored the call and sent an email explaining that she changed it ‚Äúfor security reasons‚Äù after seeing I tagged the emails for her.

Since then, I‚Äôve been spiraling. My birthday was a couple of days ago, and the other CEO (my boss's fianc√©), another manager, and two coworkers all texted me happy birthday within 30 minutes.

r/NoStupidQuestions,Did I buy from someone laundering stolen property?,"For context, a while back I purchased a replacement control panel off eBay for a model of Pentair pool pump because the old one's LCD screen was dying from age and sun exposure.

Unfortunately, I wasn't quite sober when I ordered the unit and managed to order the wrong model, just a version number older than my unit. Nevertheless, the unit sort of worked. It wasn't a drop-in replacement, but I was able to use some wire nippers to cut away some of the plastic ribbing, and was able to do various other destructive modifications so that the thing *kind of* fit on the pump... except, ultimately, it didn't fit well and would certainly not be weatherproof any longer.

I ended up giving up my botched effort and reinstalled the old panel. I then sheepishly messaged the eBay seller asking if they would give me a partial refund, at their discretion, given the item still was functional and could be made to fit on the model pump originally intended for with some effort. I even described the pieces and parts I'd methodically ripped and nipped and torn apart in detail.

I was blown away, however, to find in my inbox the following day an email saying basically no problem, I'll just give you a **full** refund. So, I returned the unit and voila, full refund, no further questions asked.

r/NoStupidQuestions,Should I tell my manager I have ADHD?,"I've been working at my job for over a year, and I feel I'm pretty good at it, minus the delays in responses to my customer contacts. But I work in software support and I feel that I have a good wealth of knowledge about the system. But this job requires constant communication and peak organization skills. I am very disorganized in pretty much every aspect of my life, from my bedroom being trashed, to my backpack being full of stray papers, to my desk being covered in sticky notes from 2 months ago, to my inbox being full of thousands of emails (not just work, my personal email too). I have spur-of-the-moment rushes of organization where I filter through my task list and filter it out, but eventually everything piles up again.

I am medicated, but I don't take it every single day. If I take it every day it helps with organization, but throughout the week I grow more and more exhausted and mentally fried at the end of each day.

My manager is an organization freak. They have everything perfectly regimented, from their schedule to their tasks and their lunch time. I wish I could get to that level, but I can't even comprehend that level of organization, let alone the amount of energy it must take. They have been on my case consistently for organization and response time issues; some weeks I'll feel like I kicked ass the previous week but they'll still look for ways I can improve my organization skills instead of giving credit for the good things I do.

To their credit they have been fantastic at helping me get more organized; if you think now is bad, you should've seen how I was when I first started. I was able to pick up good habits fast, but there came a point where things plateaued and it became harder to keep up the high expectations.

I haven't told anyone at my company that I have ADHD, but I've lately been considering telling my manager so that they know. The only thing is I fear it would result in expectations to be lowered and my company would eventually try to indirectly persuade to quit, e.g. smaller or entire lack of raises. If anyone has any unique tips on how someone with ADHD can improve their organization skills, I would love to hear them.

r/NoStupidQuestions,Can working too much affect your performance?,"Hi everyone, I am hoping someone can help me.

I have about four almost five years experience out of uni now and I have always been a top performer. I work hard, I get promotions, I get great feedback. I have received steady payrises.

However my current company has taken advantage of this and I am now working close to 80 hours a week when usual overtime has taken me to about 50. My contract says 37.5 hours with reasonable overtime expected. As a result I am missing things in my inbox and clients are complaining. I have never had this problem before. I work in advertising. I am trying my best but I guess I am simply missing things.

My manager wants to talk to me about it tomorrow. I want to know how much of this is my fault because I feel really guilty, but I don't know if I can blame the overworking.

Links: there is one link to telegram.org...it's not redirected to anywhere fishy.

No attachments or anything like that.

What makes me suspicious are 1. the gmail accounts 2. the shockingly high pay-rate 3. the iffy style (weird capitalization, no spaces after periods, etc) and 4. the weird telegram interview.  I haven't had too many job interviews in my life, but I've never heard of one using telegram, especially where you're expected to say ""I AM READY"" at any moment.  

When I google the name of the company, there is a company that pops up that's big enough to have a wikipedia page, makes about a billion a year in revenue.  But there are no logos on the email or anything.  It's quite possible that it's a separate company in a separate industry.  

As you can tell I'm already about 90% sure this isn't legit.  I just wanted confirmation because maybe this is a real offer but they're just a bit unprofessional and companies really send out offers this way, and 35/hr is very good pay.

r/NoStupidQuestions,I need advice on something that happened with me and my job.,"I am a teenager and I work at restaurant as a busser. I have a history of being late, and I hate that I have that history.

The first time I was late was a misunderstanding where I forgot to check the schedule. Everything was okay and I wasn't in any trouble. This was on a Saturday.

The second time was when I forgot to check the schedule and it was my fault. I was told I'd be terminated if I was late again. Granted, that might have been because this was the Sunday after the first time I was late, so I was late twice in a row.

Now the third time is a bit complicated, so bare with me.

I get a call saying I'm late to work by about a half hour. While being driven, I frantically search my whole inbox to see if I got the schedule. Turns out I couldn't find it and I told my manager that I couldn't find it. She said she'd talk to my scheduling manager and see what could be done.

After work, I went to check my email to search even harder for that schedule, and I did find it. However, usually when I get my schedule, my time shows up and I don't have to download the entire message. This time, my time didn't show up, and I actually downloaded the entire message and it turns out that I was working.

So what should I tell my managers? Should I tell them that I usually don't have to download the entire message to see my time, and this time I did have to download it? Should I not mention it? I'm so confused. I can clarify any details if I have to.

r/LifeProTips,"LPT: if you call a suicide hotline and get put on hold, it‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt care about you! We also don‚Äôt read off of scripts. Other misconceptions below.","I have worked at a suicide hotline for about 2 years now and I have found that there are many misconceptions about suicide and crisis hotline workers and volunteers.  I can‚Äôt speak for every organization, but I hope that I can address a few of the general concerns that I see now so that you feel more comfortable calling.

1.  ‚ÄúWhy did I get put in a queue? Do they not care that I‚Äôm about to kill/hurt myself?‚Äù  We absolutely DO CARE! Please, please stay on the line.  At my organization, when you call you first talk to a ‚Äúcrisis screener‚Äù who‚Äôs job it is to take down whatever information you want to give them and then send you to one of two queues.  One queue is for people actively wanting to commit suicide and the other is for people in general crisis but not suicidal.  This is where some people get stuck on hold for a while because we are actively taking calls from the queue as they come in.  Every night is different and every shift is different. Sometimes I‚Äôll get 3 calls in 4 hours and I can really take my time with each person.  Other times, we have 10 people waiting in the queue but I still want to give each person their respective time to de-escalate.  We can also see if someone has dropped from the queue and it always makes me sad to see that someone hung up.  I want to talk to you. We all want to help.

2. ‚ÄúWorkers just talk from a script so there‚Äôs no point in calling‚Äù.  This is absolutely not true.  When you talk to me, I‚Äôm given a blank notepad and that‚Äôs it.  Through extensive training, we learn about ways to help you de-escalate your thoughts, open up and feel comfortable, and help you specifically identify what you are feeling in a crisis moment.  Our onboarding teachers really focused on how every caller is different and every situation is case-dependent. I would never boil down your experiences to a script. 

3. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to call again tonight because I‚Äôve already called once and I‚Äôm going to bother them‚Äù.  Please feel comfortable calling as many times as you need if you are in active crisis.  Most likely you won‚Äôt even be talking to the same phone worker as everyone goes into the same queue.  I would say about 50% of my calls are people who I regularly hear from every day/week - they say their name or I recognize their voices.  20% are likely callers who have already called once in the night and need to talk again.  This is perfectly fine and I‚Äôm happy to explore what worked for you last time you called and what can work again this time.

4. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to hang up on me‚Äù.  We are not allowed to hang up on anyone (and I wouldn‚Äôt want to) unless they are being abusive to us or won‚Äôt let us speak.  We get a surprising amount of prank calls and people who call just to scream at us.  THAT BEING SAID - I have accidentally hung up on people before.  I feel absolutely horrible when this happens but I hope that everyone knows that they should call back.  If I am actively talking to you or you are telling a story and we get disconnected, know that I didn‚Äôt get bored and hang up. Something definitely happened on the worker‚Äôs line.

5. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to call because they will record what I‚Äôm saying and it will be used against me later.‚Äù  From my knowledge, most privately and gov owned phone lines do not record phone calls.  Some that I am unaware of may have different standards but at least with the ones I‚Äôm aware of in my state and National level, we all make it very clear before your call that we are 100% anonymous.  We don‚Äôt record conversations or calls - I don‚Äôt even think our phones can do that.  Most times I take notes so that I can remember your name and specific hardships that you mention but we have shredders all around the office to discard those after we hang up.  You are also welcomed to not disclose your name if you have something really personal that you feel scared to let out.  If you are ever unsure about what is being recorded, please ask your phone worker and they will tell you what your organization allows. 

6. ‚ÄúMy problems are too big for them to handle‚Äù.  We have heard everything, trust me.  Everything from teens wanting to shoot up their schools to people who are having affairs to people calling us so that they can masterbate.  Nothing you say will surprise us or be too much for us to talk you through.  

I‚Äôm happy to answer any more questions in the comments if you have additional things that you are curious or unsure about.  I greatly recommend that you print out your local crisis line‚Äôs number and hang it on your fridge and enter it to your phone.  You have no idea how many calls we get from children/teens who got our number from their parents/friend‚Äôs parents either directly or indirectly.

If you are looking to find a hotline in your country, please refer to this link: https://www.suicidestop.com/call_a_hotline.html.  I recommend if you are in the United States that you look up a free, 24 hour hotline in your city or state (rather than the National hotline) as they will be more likely to have a smaller queue and can also give you strong resources within your zip code or area.  You can save this number for if you are having an emergency.  Never hesitate to call the National hotline either, though which can be found at that link.

Please call us.  We are ready and eager to help.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Edit:  concerning mandated reporting to 911 because many people are asking about it, every organization is different.  For mine, we are mandated reporters in cases where people are in active suicide or planning to hurt someone else.  We don‚Äôt call the police but we do call 911 and we have no control over what they decide is best in that situation (whether they should get cops involved or just emergency services.). However people saying that they feel suicidal is far from being in active suicide.  Even people that have access to suicidal methods, like if someone has a gun or pills in their home, we will not call unless they are actively trying to use them to kill themselves.  De-escalation is our main priority.

That being said, if we do need to call the 911, my call center and certain others have no way of knowing where the caller is since we are a 100% anonymous call center.  Some organizations may have trackers or can give your number away but we either have to convince people to call 911 themselves so that their location can be shared or we have to talk it out of them.

For example, I got a call one time from a lady who had just taken a bunch of sleeping pills and just wanted someone talk to while she died.  Through about 20 minutes of conversation I was able to get her to tell me where she was located and so emergency services were sent.  This is pretty rare and it only is required maybe once every couple of months.  Many people are sharing stories of themselves getting hurt by police and thrown into mental wards. I know that this is common and this is why my organization really doesn‚Äôt call 911 much.  Again, I cannot control if the 911 operator decides if the police should be involve or not and if this does happen if you get taken to a psych evaluation at a hospital.  My job in that moment is to save your life and remember, it‚Äôs not a choice - I‚Äôm a mandated reporter to 911 which means I‚Äôm required to call.  I try HARD AS HELL to prevent this from happening though but some situations are dire.  I really recommend asking whatever hotline you are calling what their mandated reporting requirements are or looking on their website under terms and conditions where it is laid out in writing.  

Most times if people are in very bad mental crisis that we cannot completely de escalate in a 30 min call, we can offer to send a mobile crisis team to your location. This involves sending two trained mental health professionals to an address that you give us and consent to them coming out to.  This is fairly common and probably happens around once every two hours on the line but it still not the most preferred conclusion.  We work very hard to help you on that phone anonymously and quickly.  I wouldn‚Äôt want anyone to be turned away from getting help because they‚Äôre scared about what me as a phone worker is going to do.

If you are ever concerned about what is reported, being recorded, etc... please ask your phone worker.  We are legally required to be transparent to you.  Thank you!


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Edit #2:  here are some additional answers to questions I‚Äôve been getting in the comments:

1.  ‚ÄúShould I still call the line if I am just depressed and not suicidal?‚Äù  There are two different types of lines that I wish were spread around more clearly.  One is a suicide-only hotline.  These workers will only answer and respond to people who are actively suicidal or having suicide ideation right now.  Many of the negative stories in the comments have people saying that they were hung up on because they weren‚Äôt ‚Äúthat depressed‚Äù.  I can‚Äôt diminish your experience and I‚Äôm sorry that it happened.  In the future, if you know that you are not actively suicidal but still need someone to call, call a ‚Äúcrisis hotline‚Äù.  These are also trained volunteers and workers who deal with general crises.  Things like if you are depressed, having anxiety, want to vent, need to cry, need to get resources for drug addiction or domestic abuse etc... this is the place to call.  It‚Äôs also okay if you call the crisis line and later end up talking about suicidal thoughts, it happens more than you know.

2. ‚ÄúHow do I get a job as a phone worker or volunteer?‚Äù  The way I did it was that I went on my local hotline‚Äôs page by searching ones near me on google.  There was a tab that said volunteer and I filled out my email and a small application on there.  Within a week, a supervisor reached out to me and asked me to fill out more information involving sending them my resume, filling out a 4 page document on why I want to work there, and undergoing a background check.  Another week or so later, I got instructions on how to join an orientation where they told me more about the work and we could choose if we were still interested or not.  After a year of being a volunteer, I applied to a bachelors-level paid position at my hotline in which I oversee other volunteers if they have questions or concerns about calls.  My organization has bachelors and masters level positions.  I got my B.S. in physiology.

3. I want to say thank you to everyone who is sharing their bad experiences here as well as their good ones.  It‚Äôs important that organizations learn from people‚Äôs shitty experiences so that we can all get better as a whole.  I‚Äôve been suicidal and have attempted in my lifetime.  I‚Äôve called a suicide hotline and had a bad experience where I felt like I was wasting their time. I also called a couple times after that and was connected to the best people I have ever had the experience talking to.  They saved my life.  I applied to help because I want to make sure that everyone has a good, or atleast fair, experience when they are speaking to me as a phone worker.  

There are a couple of things that I recommend if you want to get the best chance at having good experience calling a phone line.  For one, I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again, National phones lines have longer queues and they are likely rushed as phone workers.  They‚Äôre not a bad resource at all but if you are of sound mind, I recommend searching and saving a smaller hotline‚Äôs number around your area that deals with suicide or crisis that way you can have them in your phone when you need them.  Next, if you are concerned about if giving away your information will be tracked or reported... ASK.  Always ask so you never feel like you were duped into having the cops called on you or your address taken.  Ask if your call is recorded, ask if your number is recorded, and ask if you can even remain anonymous.  I don‚Äôt care what information you give me about yourself, I care about helping you get through tonight.  Many of this information can be found on your hotline‚Äôs website under the terms and conditions. Read through these if you don‚Äôt want to ask.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

I have taken a break from this account indefinitely.  I don‚Äôt know what some of you want from me. I made an informational post based on MY experiences as a phone line worker and told you all of my knowledge on how to have the best chances at a good experience because often people have bad ones.  I‚Äôve called 911 on probably about 5 people in my whole career because they already took active measures to end their life or were planning on ending someone else‚Äôs soon.  They also knew that I was going to call and GAVE ME THEIR INFORMATION AND LOCATION because they realized that they needed in-person and immediate help that we cannot give them.  I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúswat them‚Äù or ‚Äúsend police to their door for no reason‚Äù.  I understand that this may be a rosey organization that I work at but the advice I gave to ask questions, call smaller hotlines, and read the terms and conditions still stand for any hotline you are calling.  Take a look at their website and understand their protocol. 

People have been messaging me that I should kill myself, that they hope I get cancer, that I‚Äôm the reason their father/mother died, I‚Äôm the reason they got sent a 20,000 dollar medical bill, I‚Äôm the reason they were trapped in a mental health facility for 7 months, I‚Äôm the reason they got beaten up by cops, etc... How can you say these things to another human being and then complain about how your own mental health was treated?  I‚Äôve been blamed for the actions of a huge line of decision-making people that I don‚Äôt even come in contact with at my job.  I‚Äôve been blamed for the actions of people at other organizations who I will never meet or talk to in my life.  I have a history of depression and suicidal ideation as stated in my post, and frankly, the comments attacking me have brought up a lot of that which is why I need to go.  I‚Äôm not upset that people have had bad experiences and are sharing them, that is inevitable and encouraged as I have also had bad experiences and we need to learn from them. I‚Äôm upset that people are messaging me really horrific things and attacking me.

I still want people to know that there are good organizations out there filled with people who want to help.  I know the comments here seem overwhelmingly negative but, often people who have had good or life saving experiences will not comment.  Not all hotlines are good but I hope, if you need it, you will still try to find one based on my advice above.  I wish I could bring all of you who have had bad experiences to my line and let you listen to the constant stream of people that we help for 8 hours a day, but I can‚Äôt and I realize that asking you to trust me after your personal, horrific experiences is too much to ask.  I hope that you all have found a therapist, psychiatrist, support group, or other healthcare professional or service and are working to heal from your mental health issues.

r/LifeProTips,LPT: How to meal plan like a champ,"My meal planning and grocery shopping habits are something I really pride myself on. Over the last 3 years, I've worked really hard to maximize efficiency in this area, therefore saving me a lot of time and money. I thought I would share my process and tips to help anyone out who might be struggling in this area. Please feel free to share any additional tricks you have!


**Get started.**

Take a look at your bank account history and add up all the money you spend on food each month. Factor in your grocery expenses, fast food, coffee, snacks from the gas station, etc. Find the average and use that as a point of comparison for how much you spend while meal planning. This part isn't mandatory but I find it really neat to compare. Commit to 1 month of meal planning. Your comparison results will be skewed if you go off track.


**Meal planning**

1. First you need to think about how all the parts of you life, habits, and preferences should factor into your plan. How many people do you need to feed? How many nights do you want to cook? How long will you realistically eat leftovers for? Do you have an obligation one evening that could affect your plan? It's really important to think about all of these things and seriously consider your family's habits. For example, I won't eat leftovers twice. If I plan for that, I always end up going off track because 3 day old food is just not appealing to me. Also, I don't feel like cooking a big meal every night, so I build in an ""easy"" meal that I can make with my toddler that doesn't take a lot of time (think Grilled cheese and tomato soup). I also enjoy spending Sundays preparing a big meal, so I know that will influence which recipes I choose for the week.

2. Choose your recipes. It's important to read the instructions and ingredients before adding them to your list. There is nothing more frustrating than getting home ready to make your meal, and realizing it should have been marinated overnight. Also, if you see an ingredient you are not familiar with, check google for substitutes. That way if you get to the store and they don't carry it, you already have an alternative in mind. This happens often with health foods which might only be carried at specialty stores. If you're trying to save money, consider which ingredients (such as meat) will be more costly. **Bonus:** If you can find recipes that use the same ingredients, this will save you money. 

3. Figure out which recipes will be made which night. I personally plan my healthier meals at the beginning of the week because I'm more motivated. By Friday, I might want some comfort food to take a load off the stress of the week. There is some flexibility to switch around meals by night, but I like to space out my meals so that I'm not eating similar things two nights in a row. If you plan to eat out, be honest with yourself and add it in your plan/budget. Don't plan 7 nights of  cooking if you can't stick to it. If you plan a meal and eat out instead, you're wasting money and food. I personally plan 4 nights of real meals, 1 easy night, 1 ""fend for yourself night"" and 1 night of eating out. 

4. Plan your lunch. Some people meal-prep lunches at night, but I find that takes way too long. I also don't want to meal prep 5 lunches on Sunday that I am sick of by Wednesday. I always make enough dinner to have left overs for both my husband and I for lunch and plan one free day to buy lunch. I would recommend this to anyone on a budget.  

5. Plan your breakfast. The costs of coffee and breakfast sandwiches really add up. A quick, healthy breakfast is not hard to plan. I normally do oatmeal, fruit, eggs or english muffins. I pick one of those things and eat them all week. I will switch it up the following week. Each of these are good for a ""grab n go"" breakfast. 


**Make your grocery list**

1. Throughout the week, keep a sticky note on your fridge. Every time you run out of something, write it on the list.

2. Make a list of all the ingredients from each recipe.

3. Take inventory. Anything on your list that's already in your pantry you can cross off. If you notice your low on a staple, add it to your list. Don't forget to consider non-food essentials (toilet paper, cleaning supplies, toiletries, etc)

4. Add all items from your collected list from the past week. 

5. Share your list with family/roommates. They can tell if you if there is something you are forgetting or if they have a request. 

6. Now re-organize your list by department. This is important. It will help you move through the grocery store more efficiently without having to go back for something you missed. I separate mine by: Dry, Frozen, non-food, dairy, bakery, meat, and produce. 


**Get to the store**

1. Don't forget to grab your coupons!

2. At the store, stay focused! If it's not on your list, don't buy it. Period. Impulse shopping is no good.

3. Start with the inner isles. Canned goods, non-food, etc. those are heavier and nothing is worse than having cans on top of tomatoes.

4. Finish up with bakery, meat and produce. If you are planning healthy meals, this should be the bulk of your cart. Produce is cheap relatively cheap and if you fill your cart with it, you will save money!

5. Double check that you've crossed everything off your list before you leave!

**TIP:** Don't forget to buy on sale, but only if it's a smart move. *DON'T* ""buy one get one half off"" on perishable items that you won't eat within the week. *DO* take up good deals on your essentials (rice, frozen vegetables, oils, condiments). Make sure to compare sales. Sometimes the store brand price is already lower than the name brand sale.


There you have it! That's really my entire meal planning and shopping process. From there, all you have to do is start cooking. It takes practice to get it down, but when you've got it figured out, it starts to get easy.


**Here are some additional tips I would recommend:**

1. Type your meal plan with links to recipes and save them. When you don't feel like meal planning, you can resort to the archives.

2. If you don't have a food processor, get one! It's cheap and saves you so much prep time.

3. Crock pot meals are amazing for those nights you want to get home and just relax. Only problem is you have to prepare them the night before or in the morning. 

4. Sign up for emails from sites like MyFitnessPal or Cooking Light. It's a great place for inspiration. 

5. Plan to have a night that you don't need a recipe for. Grilled chicken and frozen broccoli requires like... zero brainwork. After a long day, that's important.

6. Remember that cooking is an art! Once you have enough experience in the kitchen, you don't need to spend as much time finding recipes. I'm at the point where I use recipes for inspiration,  but I change them depending on my preferences. 

6. Remember to bring your lunch! What's the point in all this if you end up buying lunch everyday anyway?! Seriously, set an alarm on your phone if you have to. But DONT FORGET YOUR LUNCH.

7. Plan desserts. I have a weakness for cookies. I actually might be addicted. If I plan in a night of cookie baking, it helps me from running to McDonald's at 9pm.

8. Remember to stay stocked on your pantry staples. [This list](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/articles/basic-pantry-101.html) can help you determine what those are

Edit: sorry guys I really dont know how to format so I've had to mess around with this a lot!

**EDIT 2:** I've gotten some requests to share a sample meal plan. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4s-npIJ0K85RktBMkF1dEduZ1lfV191bHhNcUo3dkVwUHp3/view?usp=sharing) is an example.

r/LifeProTips,"LPT: Most people are posting pics of them from the begining of the decade in order to show how far they've progressed in life. If you find that boring, how about using Google's servers to find out what you were EXACTLY THINKING 10 years ago","This is sort of a double life pro tip, one that can be used to increase your privacy, as well as give you insights of how you acted 10 years ago, what you were interested in, how your interests grew, and just how stupid you might have been. Now before I continue, I happen to find this extremely fascinating, others may find this extremely creepy. However, do what you will with this information.

First, in order to start this, make sure you're **signed into Google using a Gmail account you've been using the longest**. The older the account, the more farther back you can look. Next go to [myactivity.google.com](https://myactivity.google.com) and you're almost there. Here where it may get creepy. It shows all your Google searches and how many times and at what times you visited any websites, searched anything on Google, and which apps you've opened. Yeah, pretty creepy. But whatever, I think you can delete it somewhere.

Next, you can click on the filter options, and just think back to when you created your Gmail account. I created mine sometime before 2012, so my account is perfect for this. Long story short, filter the options using only the dates and set it to January 1st, 20XX, whatever that might be for you. And there you go, look back to what you Googled and which apps you were using and whatnot. More often than not, this will be nostalgic, and a bit creepy. But whatever. After looking back for a bit, I started rememebering what video games I was playing, which YouTubers I used to watch, and what information I was Googling.

Stay safe and Happy New Years.

EDIT: It's organized in a very weird way. You cannot choose to view older information first. Newest is always at the top.

r/LifeProTips,LPT: Use 'yourUsername+anyalias@gmail.com' for quick e-mail aliases with gmail. Then create a filter in your inbox to move messages sent to this address to a new folder or label. Example below.,"I use gmail for Enterprise, and I have the option to create quick e-mail aliases in my admin account. I love this feature, and was curious about it's availability in standard, tradition gmail accounts. Turns out, you don't actually have to create or setup anything for an alias. Just enter an email address in this format:

&gt; gmailusername+Notes@gmail.com

Any e-mail sent to *gmailusername+Notes@gmail.com* is actually being sent to **gmailusername@gmail.com**.

This becomes super-useful when you then create a simple filter in your gMail inbox to move any message sent to *gmailusername+Notes@gmail.com* to a specific folder, likely called Notes. Or just apply a specific label to these messages, whatever you prefer.

What free time we have is spent on chores. I'm hoping someone knows a way we can better organize our schedules/meals/communications so we aren't so stressed and can actually *enjoy* time with the kiddos.

Looking for a tip or app or service that can:

- track routine schedule activity (school/work times, extracurriculars, birthdays, anniversaries, etc.)
- send text reminders
- track chore list schedule (daily/weekly/monthly)
- 
- be shared with people who don't have the service
- send automated well wish text messages (connect to phone contacts and send generic ""Have a great birthday!"" on the right day to the right contact)
- connect to sites I specify and search keywords once a week to send me a list of events I may be interested in; then add them to the calendar if I approve (I know this is a long shot, but I'm throwing it out there)
- notify me if there is a schedule conflict
- enables non-owners to suggest event changes which an owner would approve
- suggests meals from pre-set list based on time in schedule (no one-hour prep if we only have half hour cook time)

I know some of these are far-fetched, but right now we've got a pen and paper schedule calendar, an app for recipes, an app for groceries, gmail calendar for birthdays, 3 sites for local events, an app for school events, emails for off-schedule school events, and nothing for our work schedules.

I'm suggesting getting groceries delivered to your door so that you don't go out and infect anyone, if you don't have this option please opt for curbside pickup and avoid going in to stores or anywhere you could infect people.

However at this point in my life It's just not as high a priority, however for me the idea of a 'clean' inbox still has value.

If gmail requires my tags to allow me to search for old e-mails, I was underestimating their abilities at search.

r/LifeProTips,"LPT: Manage your work inbox by responding, delegating/including, saving, or deleting","I learned this technique about two years ago from a consultant friend and have found it very useful ever since. To use this method, you will want to only check your email when you have approximately ten minutes to spare. Create four mental categories for your inbox:

1) Quick response: If the email includes a simple task for you to accomplish or a quick response - either of which can be accomplished in two minutes or less - respond and/or accomplish the task. If the email requests time-sensitive work that may require more time, rearrange your schedule if possible and accomplish the task. Otherwise see option #3.

2) Delegate/include: If the email requires action or work from several individuals who are not included on the original mail, reply/forward to bring in all relevant parties with an outline of exactly what needs to happen, along with what you will contribute. This creates a line of communication between all involved parties and should ideally lead back to option #1 or ahead to option #3.

3) Save: If the email includes a task that will require a significant amount of your worktime, mark as unread and return to the task when you have time set aside. I try to have a block of time set aside on Mondays and Fridays for these larger tasks; this will certainly vary with your work. Re-read the email and respond when you sit down to accomplish the task.

4) Delete: If the email does not require action or response, delete or archive it.",6,2,2017-02-04 03:26:21,inbox management,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/5rxyq0/lpt_manage_your_work_inbox_by_responding/
r/LifeProTips,LPT: Just add periods to your Gmail address,"If you need to sign up for something more than once, you don't have to create multiple email addresses if you have Gmail. Just add periods.

Gmail addresses basically ignore the existence of periods. This means that email messages sent to yourname123@gmail, your.name.123@gmail , and y.o.u.r.n.a.m.e.1.2.3@gmail will get into your inbox regardless. 

You don't have to register these with Gmail. It works with your current personal Gmail account. Just try emailing yourself with a period or two  in the address.

I use this sometimes when I want to sign up for something - like a discount for signing up to a newsletter - and it says email already used. Instead of creating a new email address, I just add a period and make a note of it somewhere to remember.

I also manage my parents unemployment claims now during the pandemic, because they aren't tech savvy at all.

r/LifeProTips,"LPT: Schedule outlook emails to send later, and other email management tips","Outlook is full of weird ways to change how your email inbox and outbox functions. Learned these from my corporate consultant BIL. 

1) want to seem like you logged on at 8am? Have an email you need to send that isn't urgent? When you type a new email, go to the options tab. From there, you can click delay delivery and set it to the next morning at 8am. Or any time, like if you said you were gonna work late but don't want to, schedule the email to send at 730pm.

2) Struggling to send complete emails or keep forgetting attachments? Worried you're going to send ""I'm worried""? You can create a rule that delays sending all emails for 2 minutes to anyone outside your organization, or all emails but those on your immediate team. This helps with that split second realization of - crap I never included that link. 

3) Do you feel like you're constantly sending the same email over again? Do you often find yourself typing the same format over and over? You can create a ""Quick Parts"" with a full template to insert into any email, complete with formatting. 

4) Have multiple projects that all the emails seem to blend together? Create a rule to move all emails from that project into its own folder. This can be done with people from certain emails, such as from a sub contractor, or with keywords in the titles, or if an email was sent to a collection of people. 

5) get a shit ton of CCs that don't really concern you? You can create a rule that separates when someone includes you on an email vs when someone sends the email directly to you. 

6) flag messages from certain people using rules, so that you can always know when your boss sends you an email and you can get alerted. Outlook already has a default folder set for any flagged items that you can then unflag and it will check off the item as completed. 

Those are the biggest ones that I use in my every day inbox and that I think are wildly useful. You can access the rules by going to File and clicking on ""rules and alerts"" below mailbox settings.

This makes the username/email for that account unique. So if it ends up in some data leak, anyone using that email to try and get into other accounts won't be able to. They'll have to spend time trying to figure out the random code out of an infinite number of possibilities.

If you use this in tandem with a password manager, you won't have to think about it ever again after creating an account. This will give you an additional layer of security, as now your email too is unique and needs to be figured out in addition to the password, and hopefully 2fa.

Most popular email service providers let you add such codes (string) in front of the email address, but all the emails end up in your inbox as usual.",12,12,2021-07-26 19:02:35,inbox management,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/os1s46/lpt_add_a_random_code_in_front_of_the_email/

I don't want to have to sign out every single time they use my device because this is my main work computer and I've also got 2 step verification enabled which just makes signing into gmail that much longer, I'm constantly accessing my email so whenever they ask (or use without asking) to use my computer I just want a 24/7 protection for my emails.

r/LifeProTips,LPT: There is no reason to save emails in your work inbox,"Several times in my life, I managed to get my work inbox to zero (and managed to keep it that way‚Ä¶for a while). It‚Äôs always been when I‚Äôve been most organized productive (and usually happiest about my job). When I feel like things are out of control at work, I usually had let my inbox not only get out of hand, but also dictate most of my day.

Most likely, you are using your email inbox for more than communication so you are not using the best tool. When I let my inbox get out of hand, it‚Äôs always because I‚Äôm using it for one or more of these things:

- Todo list
- File storage
- Contacts list
- Project planning
- Knowledge repository
- Notes
- Content sharing/co-authoring

Those are just a few examples of things your inbox is not particularly good at, but we almost all use it for these things from time to time. Having a good set of tools helps establish good habits that help you delete those emails without fear of losing anything important. Simply put the important information in the right tool for that info, then delete the email.

Perhaps the worst thing about your inbox is it is only accessible by you. Many of the activities listed above are best shared with a team or organization. If possible, use the option that best enables everyone.

This might sound like you should be a slave to your email inbox to keep it empty. I believe the opposite is true: by spending a few minutes several times a day moving important info out of your inbox and into the right tool, you will establish good habits which will make you more effective and likely happier at work. 

If you‚Äôre skeptical, here are some examples:

- When you get an email on a topic including people outside your immediate circle, either add the people to your contact list and tag their contact with the topic, or create a note for that topic and list the key contacts (or both).
- When you get instructions on how to do something via email, put the instructions in a note or, better yet, on a team wiki.
- When you get assigned a task via email, add it to the tool your team uses to manage work if possible, otherwise use a personal task list. Ideally, respond to the sender and ask them politely to use the team‚Äôs tool for assigning work.
- When you get an email for something you can delegate, assign the task (ideally on whatever tool your team uses to manage work or, worst case, forward the email).
- When you get an email that seems best handled in real-time, reply with a link to your team‚Äôs messaging system with a note such as ‚Äúmoving conversation to Slack‚Äù.
- Use rules to filter internal spam or noisy system generated emails so you can handle them in bulk.

Obviously, you would delete the email out of your inbox after each of these.

TL/DR; Set a goal to keep your work inbox empty. Using better tools will help you be more organized (and probably happier).",0,11,2021-07-06 19:21:47,inbox management,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/oeybot/lpt_there_is_no_reason_to_save_emails_in_your/

r/LifeProTips,LPT: Do not block communication from problematic people.,"**If it is at all possible to mark something as read without deleting it or blocking the problematic party, you should do it. Otherwise, do your best to just ignore it and auto mark their stuff as read.**

Whether it's a gaslighting family member, an ex who is a parent to your children, or a co-worker - It is better to let people foam at the mouth at you in writing than to block them.

Use inbox rules to auto-archive their messages, ignore them, respond to them cordially, it doesn't matter. It's fine to ignore and block verbal communication but blocking written communication could cost you.

If you have a verbal altercation with a coworker and you blocked them from being able to send you hate mail, you miss out on that evidence. If you blocked your ex-wife and she sent you a rant about her infidelity and how you're not the parent to her children? You won't see it and you'll miss out on the ability to deal with it legally.

These are hypotheticals, but they happen.

I cling to CYA protocol - Cover your ass. In my employment, I constantly get instructions in writing. I do the same thing in my personal and financial life. I managed to save myself $1,200 in October because my loan refinance person said in writing that if I closed by X date, I would not owe my October home payment. So when my bank pulled the money, they were forced to refund it based on written communication. If I had trusted them enough to do everything verbally, I'd have been screwed.

My spouse's family is full of narcissistic gaslighters, and by relegating 99% of my communication to written I've managed to avoid a Jerry Springer/Maury lovechild season's worth of drama. Even if this doesn't save you money, it can still save you stress if you learn to ignore the messages as they come in.

**Note:** If you are suffering trauma or something that makes this very difficult, consider setting up a replacement social account so that you can continue to receive messages without having to see or interact with them. If this is not possible, but you have a trusted friend close to the situation, see if they will check your messages for you until the situation blows over. They can take screenshots or forward messages as necessary and delete them when they are done. It's more work and requires a trusted friend, but it can be critical to keep this information depending on the situation.",19,3,2021-11-07 03:34:23,inbox management,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/qoe9nr/lpt_do_not_block_communication_from_problematic/

I use Excel to buy products that we then sell on to our customers.

Today I had a review with my manager and he has asked me to focus on two things.

- Attention To Detail.
- Follow Through.

They are both fairly self explanatory. Personally I believe that they both stem from a lack of organisation on my behalf. I get overwhelmed by the volume of emails, queries and extra tasks to deal with.

I have tried to stay on top of things by doing the following...

- I have created a detailed checklist using Excel to keep track of my main duties.
- I created a rule in outlook that anything directed to my department goes in one folder and everything else goes in another.
- I have an A4 pad lined notebook where I can jot down extra tasks or reminders to do something for some one.

About a quarter of the time this is pretty effective. For the other three quarters its not.

By the time I had done that I had more emails than originally started and was behind on my tasks.

Do we need all five backups: security key, authenticator, phone number, back-up codes, prompt etc??

Additionally, if we do need all five backups, what is the best fido Security key that will work between two emails and 2-4 different computers? I am trying to research this all online, but it is kind of beyond me.

r/techsupport,Two updates bricked my two of my devices and I'm completely locked out of my digital life.,"**The phone:**

My Pixel phone died on me, beyond repair. Took it to a repair shop and tried everything unde the sun myself. It updated to Android 15, and never recovered. Hardware must have fried or something. 

**The Carrier:**

Public mobile is a canadian carrier with no physical stores, and support is done 100% online. Its cheap. The phone that died, had an E-SIM, not a physical SIM. I can't log into the carrier site to request support, because it requires me receiving an SMS, and the phone is dead.

**The PC:**

The only PC with access to my accounts ran a windows update overnight and when I booted back, my pin was corrupted (error 0xd0000225). It asks for the password to my microsoft account, which I don't use, or ever used. 

**The microsoft account:**

Restoring the password to my microsoft account means accessing my ""associated email"", which is my Gmail, and my account. I filled out the account request form for the microsoft account, but the request was denied because I never used that email, so there's not enough information about it.

**The Gmail account:**

My Gmail account is the center of all of my digital life, and it was only on two devices, both of which are not accessible. I know the password, but the MFA options are: Press \`yes\` on the device (which is dead), receive a SMS code (in a device which is died, and died with its E-SIM, so there's no changing the SIM around), or using passkeys which I never setup.



I'm extremely organized and tech savvy. I use password managers, MFA for everything and maintain my digital live pretty tidy. I did not prepare for two devices bricking or locking me out in the span of two days and have no idea how to get out of this loop.",0,14,2025-02-15 19:43:44,gmail organization,https://reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1iq6qy2/two_updates_bricked_my_two_of_my_devices_and_im/

r/techsupport,"Using a HP Omen 15, my Google Meet uses my microphone for a few minutes and then it suddenly shows there's something wrong with my mic.","I am using a HP Omen 15, my music institute uses Google Meet to organize and take classes for students online. I have a built - in microphone, listed as Microphone Array - Intel Smart Sound Technology, another microphone that comes along with my wireless/wired headset, and a USB condenser microphone. The browser I currently use is Opera GX, if that doesn't work I go with the built - in Microsoft Edge. I have GX for it's ad blocking features, and it is quite annoying to constantly log into YouTube or any Google app while using other AdBlock browsers such as Brave since I frequently use YouTube, Meet and Gmail.

Since a few students complained about the background fan noise from my side, I had installed Equalizer APO on my PC to use a noise cancellation VST plugin. It worked just fine for the first few days but recently, my HP Omen 15 takes a longer time than usual to detect the connected microphones to gain access to use it. For example, before joining a call, the default device listed under microphone is Microphone Array (I rarely use my headset microphone unless it's wired) and the button is colorless, meaning it's unmuted. After checking all of that I log in, I begin talking to my student, and the microphone button suddenly changes to orange with an exclamatory mark on it's top right edge saying the microphone you have selected isn't working, try reloading the page to fix the problem.

I then reload the page, hoping it fixes the issue but the issue persists. So I decide to switch to my headset mic but in vain, even that shows the same issue. The same goes for my condenser mic too! They work for a few seconds and then stops working.

Is Equalizer APO interfering with the microphones? Is Opera GX the culprit? But even if I try to log in via Edge and use it the problem persists. Other apps e.g. Zoom; WhatsApp and Skype do not have a problem using the microphones. I also have a hypothesis that WhatsApp is taking away the mic access even if I have it open in background.

Can someone please help me with this? I'm looking to solve it before my next class in the evening.

P. S. : I had forgotten to mention the DAW Spectrasonics Keyscape in question; I use ASIO4ALL with it, and I make sure the ASIO isn't using any of the mics while Keyscape is open before opening Google Meet, I connect a wired speaker to go with the ASIO and the Bluetooth for Google Meet; this has always been my setup for class.

r/techsupport,Help with security PLEASE,"Hello,

I am new to the privacy movement and also security space. I am working to clean up my privacy and up my security after a fraud and potential identity theft scare via Apple ID.

I really want some advice and feedback to my security plan PLEASE. I am very anxious because of the hack.

I know it‚Äôs a long read but I am in need of some real advice as I want to implement this plan ASAP.

I want to be extra careful for more peace of mind and to have an organized system in place so I can turn off or catch any breaches early.

Based on my research I want to do these things in this order:

1. Get all new email addresses, give them all aliases before using them

2. Get a virtual address with mail forwarding to my real address

3. Open up 2-3 credit cards for paying bills, online shopping and in person shopping to protect my debit and bank acct numbers

4. Changing phone numbers to a new one while keeping my old one as a virtual number

5. Figuring out whether to go with Apple, android or a flip phone!

6. Changing carrier (is there something better out there?)

7. Finally a credit freeze

8. Slowly work on opting out of everything, deleting old accounts on old emails + opting out of credit card offers

(Should I do them in a different order? Or omit any steps?)



Here‚Äôs my plan based on research I have done:

**1. Have several email accounts, each with an alias and used for different reasons.**

(Prior to this I had one main gmail I used for almost everything, and it‚Äôs full is spam and marketing emails now)

I‚Äôve learned about proton mail and am wondering if I can use proton mail for things finances like banking and credit cards alongside social media or for shopping. I plan to only use the free plan for now. Do they offer aliases and if not what is a good program for generating aliases?

Is gmail still good to use? I‚Äôm hesitant to rely on them as much because I know they read our emails. Also MFA has been a pain in the ass with them. I‚Äôve been having a hard time opening new emails without continuing to use my old phone number that has already been exposed. I hate having to rely on 2FA with SMS. I really wish I didn‚Äôt have to have my phone number associated with Google for everything!!!

**Email breakdown and their uses:**

1. Personal and never shared (this will be the Proton Mail which is my master email)

2. Banking
3. Phones

4. Credit Cards + Credit Karma + PayPal (Is PayPal safe to use?

5. Social Media (IG and maybe FB/Youtube) if I even decide to use social media anymore - these will all be under a pseudonym as well

6. Reddit - I know Reddit has had their own breaches but I love using Reddit as a resource for information and learning

7. Online shopping + shipping notifications (I want to turn off newsletters and promotions to avoid a cluttered mailbox + have a virtual address to protect my location)

8. Professional email for jobs and other people

9. One for gaming (I mostly play solo and not online)

**(Does this sound excessive? What are your recommendations?)**

With all new organized emails and aliases, I can keep track of what has been breached and switch to a new alias if needed without compromising the real account.


**2. Getting a virtual address**

I want to conceal my address as much as possible. I moved recently so most of my accounts are associated with a lot of old addresses. I want to take this opportunity to conceal it as much as possible.

Is there a way to do this online? I would like to set up a mail forwarding system so when I provide my virtual address for shipping purposes.

I haven‚Äôt researched this as much. I know USPS and some states have protection services they can offer. I really need recommendations here.

Once I have this done I‚Äôm more okay opening up new credit cards and phone lines so they won‚Äôt be associated with my real address if that‚Äôs even possible with phone companies and banks.


**3. Opening up credit cards**

I have had breaches in the past where my bank was compromised via debit cards. The scammers I dealt with also posed as my bank which was terrifying.

I have just learned through my research that it‚Äôs better to use credit cards + virtual credit cards as a sort of double layer of protection versus using your actual debit card which is connected directly to your bank.

Essentially I won‚Äôt even carry my debit card around. It will only be for if I need cash from the bank. Otherwise I‚Äôll pretend it doesn‚Äôt exist and get a new one often.

I was thinking 2 virtual credit cards:

1. One for paying bills online

2. One for online purchases (I also have PayPal, is it a safe and recommended method for online shopping? I‚Äôve used PayPal credit for years without any issues. I have an offer for their cash back credit card but have not utilized it yet. And can I pay for my PayPal credit with a credit card as well as an added layer of protection?)

And finally, **one** physical credit card for in person purchases like gas, groceries and toiletries. (is there a way to protect this credit card too?)

**Any recommendations here on which credits cards are best?

I‚Äôve heard of Klutch for virtual cards but also heard about Capital One offering virtual card options as well unique numbers for every site you shop on as an added layer of protection. Capital One I would have a physical card AND be able to get virtual cards as well but don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll give me any compatibility issues on Apple iOS and is capital one is trustworthy.

**For a physical credit card for in person purchases, would an Apple wallet be a safer way to keep the card? Or should I be okay using the physical card? If I get capital one cards, should I get two (one for online stuff on for in person?)


**4. Changing phone numbers**

So the number I currently have has been with me for at least 2 decades now. Obviously it‚Äôs tied to my identity and not only that, it is used for 2FA SMS for so much of my stuff that I hate it! If someone SIM hacked my phone it‚Äôs game over. I hate relying on SMS 2FA and am looking into alternative MFA options like an authenticator (open to recommendations)

Clearly my number has been exposed since I was the victim of a fraud attack. I want to get a new number but also hold onto my old one so nobody can use it for anything nefarious.

In my research saw that I should convert it to a Google Voice number or a virtual number just to keep control over it even if I don‚Äôt use it for anything else anymore.

Also with a new number I would use a **burner app** or some sort of number alias to protect my real number because unfortunately and inevitably we have to give it out when we shop, apply for things or even for work.

What is the best process to do this? My current plan is to get a new phone and number  and set up a burner number(s) with that one while holding onto my old number.

Transfer all my important emails and info information to the new, private and aliased number, and then convert my current and old number to a Google Voice.

Should I have a burner number just for my bank accounts? That‚Äôs the asset I want to protect most because of obviously I need money to pay my bills and stuff.


**5. Potentially leaving iPhone**

I am also concerned with hacking of Apple IDs. 

My recent experience with Apple has been frustrating and I am very disillusioned with iCloud and Apple ID and want to refrain from relying on them as much as possible as there was an attack on my Apple ID and it was almost hacked.

Fortunately I think I was able to secure it but getting the other phone off my account has been a blind chase and most representatives couldn‚Äôt or didn‚Äôt want to help me) solve the issue.

We have had issues making changes on my account, recovering lost information or even trying to make changes on my phone due to it being attached to another iPhone now and it‚Äôs been extremely frustrating.

I feel so exposed because of my iCloud and the struggles of Apple ID having access to so much personal information.

I know it‚Äôs meant for convenience but now I am traumatized and absolutely do not want to keep so much of my personal information saved in one online digital space that‚Äôs easily hacked.

Moving forward I am extremely hesitant to use any cloud services, will not be saving passwords and will use my phone minimally for personal things like finances or shopping.

Is android any more secure or less invasive at least? Maybe one could make an argument as to why its GOOD to use these company‚Äôs cloud systems but I might refrain from using financial apps on my phone at all versus just logging into make quick payments on a browser like Brave or Tor.

**Also should I even be using banking and financial apps on my phone?**

I plan to not save passwords and usernames at all in case my phone is lost of stolen.


**6. Switching carriers**

I am currently with T-mobile and have had them for a while. I learned recently they have had issues with data breaches as well and SIM transfer hacks scare me too. I know that‚Äôs not just a T-mobile issue but is there a type of phone or different carrier who might be better?

With 2FA relying on SMS I am just unnerved about it all. Is that just the world we live in now? Is it inevitable that I will have to use SMS for MFA?

Imagine my number getting hacked or phone stolen. I will be locked out of all my important emails and accounts üò≠

If anyone has other security options to share please let me know. I hate this new digital world where everything is overly interconnected and there is no privacy anymore.

I know some carriers and phone brands claim to be more secure etc. I‚Äôm just so disgusted that I can‚Äôt get away with not having to give out a phone number for everything. SMS 2FA is such a liability in my eyes.

Unfortunately I can‚Äôt not have a phone. Maybe I should just use a flip phone instead (half joking but also not)

I was thinking of moving to Mint Mobile since I hardly use my phone for calls anyways. Mostly I want unlimited data so I can do research and study on my phone. I know Mint Mobile has its limitations but it‚Äôs also cheap.


**7. Credit freeze**

Ultimately putting in a credit freeze with the big 3 and working my way down to the smaller ones like Chex etc. I want to do this only after I‚Äôve gotten my credit cards for bills etc. Will a freeze affect me if I plan to use virtual cards and need to open new ones under Capital One maybe?


**8. Opt-outs**

This will the final arduous journey in working my way down opting out of all the data sellers. I have a big fat opt out list ready to go but this will take me some time.

**In conclusion:**

If you somehow made it all the way down here thank you. I am pretty shaken up and struggling to navigate the world of online privacy and cyber security on my own. I hope the good people in this sub will help guide me through my journey.",1,8,2024-06-27 00:57:01,gmail organization,https://reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1dpas0c/help_with_security_please/
r/techsupport,Gmails 'auto deleting' upon receipt or while in inbox,"I have a Gmail through which we run our business, and for the past 3 months our emails seem to be ‚Äòauto deleting‚Äô. By auto deleting I mean that new emails coming in AND emails that are already in the inbox get sent to the trash without any user input. Sometimes this happens so instantly when I receive an email that I never see it (I have now made it a habit to look in the trash every time I check emails). Even if I select every email in the trash and send them back to the inbox, 10 minutes later they will mostly if not all be back in the trash again. Not every single email auto deletes, but a good 85% of them do end up in the trash.

I had a few filters set up initially, which I thought was the issue (an incorrectly inputted filter or something) but have since removed all my filters and the issue has not been resolved.

However, I‚Äôve looked through all the settings and could not find anything out of the ordinary that would give permissions to delete emails in Gmail itself ‚Äì plus not all the emails that are auto deleting are coming from HelpMonks, some are payment transfers notifications from the bank, or e-bills for phone, hydro, etc.¬†

r/techsupport,Overwhelmed by Email Management in Our Growing Small Business,"**TL;DR**: Many apologies in advance if this isn't the right place but we're kind of out of ideas - please feel free to point me elsewhere (even if that elsewhere is just the exit door). Our small business is swamped by the daily deluge of emails (300-500 emails/day), requiring a manual review to differentiate new document review requests from ongoing project correspondences. This process involves one dedicated admin who manually sorts, allocates, and follows up on tasks - a method that‚Äôs neither scalable nor failproof. We're in dire need of an automated/software solution to:

* Automatically categorize incoming emails.
* Allocate tasks according to a round-robin/capacity system or based on ongoing engagements.
* Efficiently manage deadlines (by the hour and minute) and follow-up actions.
* Has some sort of reporting so we can track customer usage, customer rep usage, request type, the time it takes us to complete the work for them, and other data about the work request.

Seeking advice on tools or strategies that could help streamline our process.-

\--

Hey r/techsupport, I‚Äôm reaching out in hopes of finding some guidance, or perhaps a lifeline, to tackle an issue that‚Äôs increasingly becoming a bottleneck for our small business‚Äôs operations and growth. Many apologies in advance if this isn't the right place but we're kind of out of ideas - please feel free to point me elsewhere (even if that elsewhere is just the exit door),

**The Backstory**:

As we‚Äôve experienced growth, the volume of inbound emails has skyrocketed. Each email is crucial - they‚Äôre either new requests for us to review and negotiate documents (the bread and butter of our services) or ongoing correspondence concerning existing requests.Currently, our entire email management process hinges on the Herculean efforts of one admin team member. Their day-to-day involves meticulously reading through each email to determine its nature, allocating the work to team members in a fair round-robin manner (unless it‚Äôs ongoing work, in which case it‚Äôs routed back to the original handler), setting deadlines, sending reminders, and chasing up post-deadline. This manual process is a mammoth task that's prone to inefficiency and human error, not to mention the stress it places on our admin.

**The Quandary**:

We're at our wits‚Äô end trying to find a more sustainable and error-proof method of managing this crucial aspect of our business. The dream solution(s) would:

* Seamlessly categorize emails into ""new requests"" or ""ongoing correspondence,""
* Automate task allocation while respecting our round-robin distribution, and also intelligently direct follow-ups to whoever is handling the corresponding task,

r/techsupport,Why can‚Äôt I check a company-managed email alias from my phone?,"My company sets up email aliases for teams to use when supporting our clients. I‚Äôm told that the only way to use this email alias is thru the Outlook web app. 

The Outlook web app sucks. 

Tech friends, does this sound accurate?? 

Details, if relevant (fake emails to illustrate); 
- My work email is pickles@work.com
- When I log in to outlook.office.com, I have to use a different email: pickles@theworksite.com
- The email alias is vendors@clientcompany-events.com

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm using the term ‚Äúemail alias‚Äù correctly, but this is what everyone at my company calls it. The functionality is:
- Multiple people can use the alias. There isn‚Äôt a password. But we have to submit a support ticket to gain access
- We can send and receive emails with the alias

r/techsupport,Need help managing multiple emails going to the same Gmail inbox [already using Superhuman],"I run a small business where I get 10-20 emails per day to the email alias associated with that business. Let's call it my @smallbusiness account. I also get personal emails from friends, family, etc to my @gmail.com account. 

For all of this I'm mostly talking about my desktop gmail. 

My employee goes into my email and deals with all of the ones that come to my @smallbusiness. She does this in Superhuman, where she only looks at the tab for the @smallbusiness emails. 

However, I don't like using Superhuman because A) I've been using Gmail for 20 years and I'm used to it and B) I'm not that young and I like being able to make Gmail font size bigger. You can't do that with Superhuman. (Response from their customer service: (There isn't a way to make just the text of Superhuman larger at the moment, but we're likely to build more accessibility options for this in the future."")

So right now throughout the day I am opening my Gmail inbox and seeing all of my emails coming in, for personal and my @smallbusiness account. I find it very stressful to see all of those emails to my small business coming in throughout the day, since most of them I do not need to know about or look at. 

The obvious answer would be to put them in a folder on Gmail, but the only way to do that is to have them auto-archive and bypass the main inbox. That doesn't work for my system because my employee needs to be able to see which messages are new and have not been archived. Once she deals with them she can archive them, but if I auto-archive them, she doesn't know which messages she needs to take action on. 

I've read a ton of posts about gmail inboxes and superhuman but I don't see a solution. It seems small but this is really causing me a lot of anguish because all day I get these stressful @smallbusiness emails that I do not need to be seeing. 

Please help! Thank you so much.",1,1,2023-11-07 04:29:34,email management,https://reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/17pk5od/need_help_managing_multiple_emails_going_to_the/

They reassured me about security and ""standard process"" and that nothing has been compromised but they couldn't explain why the admin account had mailbox delegation to some individual mailboxes. Still they swore black and blue that they're super secure and take privacy seriously. It sounds like a bit of sloppy but not necessarily malicious work. Azure and Orchestrator related.

Our Office Manager (OM) is a lady in her 50s and is moderately computer illiterate.  She received an email on her work email from ""UPS"" about her package that couldn't be delivered.  The email contained an attachment, which she downloaded.  The OM and Boss (also somewhat computer illiterate, but not nearly as bad as OM) were already working on trying to fix the situation by the time I arrived at the office.

I attempted to run malwarebytes, to no avail.  I then attempted two separate system restores.  The first was to restore to 3 days prior, and the second to 7 days prior.  Both of these restores failed.

Boss hired an IT guy from in town to work on it.  IT guy said he couldn't fix anything, so he backed up what he could and wiped the computer.  He also said that he needed some code from the virus creator or something.  This is hearsay from Boss, so I didn't directly hear the IT guy this.  So I'm not sure what exactly the IT guy said that he needed.

We lost a lot of info.  We had records dating back to the beginning of the year - all gone.  I have the original record files that I personally work with, but the rest has been wiped.  

When I try to open the Excel spreadsheets, it says:

*  ""Excel cannot open the file '[NAME OF FILE].xlsx' because the file format or file extension is not valid.  Verify that the file has not been corrupted and that the file extension matches the format of the file.""

I immediately ran an antivirus and it caught a Trojan horse. So I think the virus is dealt with. I ran multiple antivirus programs multiple times now. Malware bytes, AVG, McAfee.
