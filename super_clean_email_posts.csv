Also, I assume before I do the above, that I should unlink the yahoo email from the 'Import mail and contacts:' section in Gmail because it will continue to import new mails for the next month?

r/gmail,Tackling Email Overload: Strategies for Enhanced Productivity,"In the fast-paced digital landscape, email overload is a common challenge that can hinder productivity and contribute to stress. Whether you're dealing with work-related correspondence, personal messages, or a combination of both, these strategies will empower you to tackle email overload and enhance your overall productivity.

**1. Declutter Your Inbox:**

* ***Issue***: Inbox overflowing with emails.
* ***Solution***: Start by decluttering your inbox. Categorize your emails using labels for easy identification. Archive or delete irrelevant emails to keep your inbox organized.

**2. Set Email Filters:**

* ***Issue***: Difficulty in prioritizing important emails.
* ***Solution***: Take advantage of email filters to automatically sort incoming emails into relevant labels. This way, you can focus on crucial messages without being distracted by the noise of less important ones.

**3. Unsubscribe Wisely:**

* ***Issue***: Too many newsletters and promotional emails.
* ***Solution***: Unsubscribe from newsletters and promotional emails that don't add value. Keep your subscriptions to a minimum and only receive updates that genuinely interest you.

**4. Schedule Dedicated Email Time:**

* ***Issue***: Constant interruptions from incoming emails.
* ***Solution***: Set specific times during the day to check and respond to emails. Avoid constantly refreshing your inbox, allowing you to concentrate on other tasks without being interrupted by the constant ping of incoming messages.

**5. Use Email Templates:**

* ***Issue***: Spending too much time composing similar emails.
* ***Solution***: Create email templates for common responses or inquiries. This can save you time and ensure consistency in your communication.

**6. Prioritize and Flag Emails:**

* ***Issue***: Difficulty in prioritizing tasks within the inbox.
* ***Solution***: Flag or mark important emails for follow-up. Prioritize tasks by creating a to-do list within your email client, making it easier to stay organized and focused.

**7. Implement the Two-Minute Rule:**

* ***Issue***: Procrastination on quick, actionable emails.
* ***Solution***: Adhere to the two-minute rule – if an email can be addressed within two minutes, do it immediately. This prevents a backlog of small tasks from accumulating.

**8. Unplug from Email Occasionally:**

* ***Issue***: Feeling overwhelmed by a constant influx of messages.
* ***Solution***: Schedule periods where you intentionally disconnect from your email. This could be during deep work sessions or when you need uninterrupted focus. Let colleagues know when you'll be unavailable to manage expectations.

**9. Use Email Productivity Tools:**

* ***Issue***: Inefficient email management.
* ***Solution***: Explore productivity tools designed to enhance your email experience. Tools like Boomerang, SaneBox, or Unroll.Me can help automate tasks, declutter your inbox, and improve overall efficiency.

**10. Regularly Review and Update Email Practices:**

* ***Issue***: Sticking to outdated email habits.
* ***Solution***: Regularly review your email management practices. As technology evolves, so should your strategies. Stay informed about new features in your email client and adjust your approach accordingly.

By incorporating these email management strategies into your routine, you'll be better equipped to navigate the digital deluge and maintain a productive workflow. Remember, mastering email overload is an ongoing process, so be patient and persistent. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance on your journey to a more organized digital life!

r/productivity,What is the best way to organize Gmail with filters?,"Hi guys, 

I'm trying to organize Gmail with filters and I know it's a very common topic, but when I googled how to actually create filters for Gmail I found out that it is extremely inconvenient to do so. 

Basically, you have to create a filter by search query, but this is actually not very easy because

1. The mails you received will NOT show on the search result. Only the addresses you sent a mail before will show up. You basically have to memorize the whole email. 
2. You can't easily append to an existing filter. Say you read an email and created a filter right away. You move on to the next email and if you want to add that sender to the same filter, you would have to go to the filter edit page and manually add the sender. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is beyond frustration. I have no idea how such a big mail client like Gmail is still very ancient. 

I wasn't satisfied with Outlook's organizing experience but compared to this, Outlook feels like a future technology.

I’ve personally decided I want to do an inbox zero approach because it really jives with my work volume and overall approach.

But one hurdle of either inbox zero or really any approach is I have a ton of crap mail I get every day.  Mixed in with juuuust enough relevant mail that makes a simple rules-based approach problematic.  Every once in a while there’s something somewhat important in that promotions tab in my Gmail.  That sort of thing.

I figure no matter what it’s going to take some decent amount of active effort to fix, but I’m happy to.  I just don’t know what the best tactics are here.  Set aside some time every day to unsubscribe? Something else?

For more context, I have 8 inboxes I deal with spread across personal and a variety of work accounts.  I’ve pulled them all into Spark Mail, which has worked very well for me.

r/productivity,[UPDATE] 3 Months After My “Overwhelmed by Emails” Post – What Actually Helped,"Hey folks,

A few months ago, I posted here, asking about your inbox numbers. I had a hundred unread emails and no system… constantly feeling behind.

I just wanted to come back with an update and say **thanks**. The advice you all shared genuinely helped. Not in a magical like zero inbox in 24 hours





# A few things that stuck with me:

* **If it takes under 2 mins, deal with it immediately.** This helped cut down so much back-and-forth.  
* **Start deleting by sender.** Someone said to find repeat senders, unsubscribe, and delete them all in one go. I started doing this while bored, and it cleared thousands of emails.  
* **Snooze stuff realistically.** I used to leave emails I couldn’t handle right away just sitting there, making me anxious. Now I snooze them to a day I can actually deal with them. Weirdly freeing.  
* **Unsubscribing as a side hobby.** I know it sounds dumb, but now I unsubscribe from junk while I’m waiting in line or whatever. It adds up.  

And someone mentioned that they set up folders or labels based on senders or keywords. I haven’t gone that far yet, but I might.

The thing is… sorting my inbox wasn’t just about email. It got me thinking about how *everyone* is buried in this same mess, especially people trying to run a business or do creative work.

Long story short: I ended up going deep into this problem and started building a small product around it. Still super early, but it’s growing. It’s a simple add-on for email inboxes for people who want to spend less time drowning in emails and more time doing the actual work that matters.

If you're into this stuff or still wrestling with inbox chaos, send me a dm.

r/LifeProTips,LPT: Have two email addresses - one for humans and one for organizations,"Organizations want your email address for marketing, and many will sell it to others, which then leads to tons of spam. There are some existing tools to help with this (Gmail's multiple inboxes, [unroll.me](https://unroll.me)), but as someone who hates having a ton of unread emails, it still takes up more time than I would like. 

Use a separate email address for all accounts. You can still log in to verify your identity/track shipping/monitor promos/pull up your order number, but it doesn't distract you from the important emails. My rule is that I only give out my ""real"" email (the one that sends alerts to my phone) to real humans. Helps me stay on top of important emails, and I can access the other one when needed.

Another option that I tried out briefly: gmail usernames ignore everything after a + and the ""."" is changeable. So if your email is [john.smith@gmail.com](mailto:john.smith@gmail.com), you can give out [j.ohnsmith@gmail.com](mailto:j.ohnsmith@gmail.com) or [john.smith+signups@gmail.com](mailto:john.smith+signups@gmail.com) and set up filters for anything sent to those emails. Ultimately I found having a separate email address was net better for just keeping it out of mind unless I needed to refer to something.",6,4,1/2/2022 19:36,email organization,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/rueofp/lpt_have_two_email_addresses_one_for_humans_and/

r/LifeProTips,LPT: Gmail Tip - Create an 'unsubscribe' label to easily kill junk emails in more convenient sessions. ,"It's easy to delete newsletters and ad emails because it's much faster at the time than going to the trouble to unsubscribe. Instead label junk emails 'unsubscribe' and archive them. Then, once a week take 15 min to unsubscribe to all emails labeled for that week. You will reduce your email management time significantly following this practice.

r/LifeProTips,"LPT: Especially if your manager is a psychopath, open your Microsoft Outlook permissions settings. Your manager may have given themselves full access to your calendar and email inbox, in which case they can monitor and change all your activities without pinging the IT department for help.","I had a manager like this.

She’d constantly check people’s email folders. If she didn’t like you and you had more than like five unread emails, she’d ping everyone, asking them to create a paper trail saying that you’re unresponsive to your emails.

She’d also use these privileges to make sure you never said anything she didn’t like.

And of course: to monitor your calendar and to make sure everyone (especially the employees she hated for no reason) was dutifully working while she’d leave the office to go do whatever she wanted all day.

The least you can do is know that your manager is snooping.",27,5,1/18/2023 21:16,inbox management,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/10ffy00/lpt_especially_if_your_manager_is_a_psychopath/
r/LifeProTips,"LPT: Use email rules to make your inbox more manageable, for example marking files with large attachments so you know what to delete first, flag emails with security notifications so you don't miss if your account is hacked, and just generally filter repetitive emails from services you use","In my previous job, I was the guy with the tidiest inbox, and would help other people setup a few rules (especially the older folks), and they really appreciated it.

I quit recently, and my Gmail inbox was a mess, especially after I signed up for a few newsletters.

So I did some thinking about the best rules I can use, stuff like:

* Marking large emails with the label ""&gt;10MB""
* Marking emails from eBay and Amazon with ""e-com"" labels
* Marking emails with keywords of newsletters and promotions as ""Newsletter | Promotion"" and making them skip the inbox

Put some of these rules in your inbox - it'll make it much easier to handle, especially if you're trying to get to ""Inbox Zero""",9,1,5/24/2022 19:00,inbox management,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/uwu6st/lpt_use_email_rules_to_make_your_inbox_more/
r/LifeProTips,"LPT: Schedule outlook emails to send later, and other email management tips","Outlook is full of weird ways to change how your email inbox and outbox functions. Learned these from my corporate consultant BIL. 

1) want to seem like you logged on at 8am? Have an email you need to send that isn't urgent? When you type a new email, go to the options tab. From there, you can click delay delivery and set it to the next morning at 8am. Or any time, like if you said you were gonna work late but don't want to, schedule the email to send at 730pm.

2) Struggling to send complete emails or keep forgetting attachments? Worried you're going to send ""I'm worried""? You can create a rule that delays sending all emails for 2 minutes to anyone outside your organization, or all emails but those on your immediate team. This helps with that split second realization of - crap I never included that link. 

3) Do you feel like you're constantly sending the same email over again? Do you often find yourself typing the same format over and over? You can create a ""Quick Parts"" with a full template to insert into any email, complete with formatting. 

4) Have multiple projects that all the emails seem to blend together? Create a rule to move all emails from that project into its own folder. This can be done with people from certain emails, such as from a sub contractor, or with keywords in the titles, or if an email was sent to a collection of people. 

5) get a shit ton of CCs that don't really concern you? You can create a rule that separates when someone includes you on an email vs when someone sends the email directly to you. 

6) flag messages from certain people using rules, so that you can always know when your boss sends you an email and you can get alerted. Outlook already has a default folder set for any flagged items that you can then unflag and it will check off the item as completed. 

Those are the biggest ones that I use in my every day inbox and that I think are wildly useful. You can access the rules by going to File and clicking on ""rules and alerts"" below mailbox settings. 

Let me know if you implement any of these into your email habits!",35,12,4/12/2021 18:08,inbox management,https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/mpfts2/lpt_schedule_outlook_emails_to_send_later_and/
